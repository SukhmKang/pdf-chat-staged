      "content": "iv Summary As ample wargaming and analysis have shown, any war with China would be economically and strategically costly, as well as fraught with the risk of escalation to nuclear war. In addition, any U.S.-China military conflict could very likely last longer than envisioned by traditional force planning scenarios, which often are designed around relatively limited objectives and call for U.S. forces and capabilities that could bring a war to a quick, decisive conclusion.  This report describes a set of scenarios of such protracted conflicts and provides what could be a foundation for more-detailed planning or analysis. To allow free creative scope for the scenario development process, we did not place a priori constraints on the meaning of “protracted,” and therefore, the resulting scenarios feature a variety of circumstances in which the United States and China could be required to sustain military operations on much longer time frames.  Scenarios We document the following nine scenarios: • Scenario 1: Great Game Redux. This scenario envisions an extreme Islamic group seizing control of most of Central Asia, leading China to invade and occupy most of the region to acquire control of its resources and prevent external support for its own Turkic Muslim populations in Xinjiang. China then controls all but a fraction of Central Asia, including parts of the Caspian shoreline, and attempts to eliminate any remaining resistance. The United States, concerned about China’s expanding influence in the region and threats to regional allies, provides forces to help Central Asian nations defend their territory from Chinese aggression. Chinese attacks on U.S. patrols lead to continuous, indecisive war in all domains, with a static war of attrition on the ground.  • Scenario 2: Under African Skies. This scenario envisions China achieving de facto control of nine African countries, installing puppet regimes, populating the countries with large numbers of Chinese citizens, and deploying Chinese military forces and police to defend China’s interests. Fearing Chinese domination of Africa and its natural resources, as well as Chinese bases on both the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, the United States sends ground forces to fight alongside the forces of the ousted governments while attempting to cut Chinese access to supplies and bombarding Chinese forces from the air. But China’s decentralized, resilient forces sustain themselves using local resources and retain control of the occupied territories, leaving the United States and its allies confined to remote jungle and mountain areas. • Scenario 3: Economic and Political Warfare at Scale (a Fight for Information). This scenario envisions gradual but concerted Chinese aggression for ownership of, access to, and control of global digital infrastructure to enable economic and political warfare at an unprecedented scale",

      "content": "v when coupled with the increasingly global ambitions of its authoritarian leaders. The United States sees an inflection point when weak partners in Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America succumb to Chinese pressure to install social-monitoring systems atop a foundation of local Chinese information infrastructure. Although each country maintains the vestiges of sovereignty, in practice, each becomes an extension of the Chinese Communist Party. The United States initiates military operations, initially with limited objectives to set the conditions necessary to restore information balance for three closely aligned partners at risk of being the next “dominos” to fall to Chinese information control. But the conflict escalates through information and trade networks to become a war of competing authoritarian versus democratic worldviews. • Scenario 4: Lost in Space. This scenario envisions a collision between Chinese and U.S. cis-lunar satellites (i.e., satellites in orbits nearly as far as the moon), triggering an escalation in which China and the United States attack each other’s cis-lunar satellites. Both sides launch large numbers of cis-lunar satellites with self-protection and mutual-protection capabilities to replace losses. Neither side escalates the conflict to other orbits, let alone to Earth, but neither side de-escalates, either. The space war evolves with minimal impact on earthly economies and politics and unbeknownst to most of the world’s population.  • Scenario 5: Russia Nukes Itself. This scenario opens with the disintegration of Vladimir Putin’s regime and the emergence of multiple nuclear-armed rival governments competing for control of the Russian Federation’s territory. The United States and its allies support a government based in Saint Petersburg that controls a large fraction of European Russia, while the People’s Republic of China (PRC) supports a government based in Novosibirsk that controls much of Siberia and Russian East Asia. Washington and Beijing send military personnel to Russia to support their respective proxies there. Conflict between the rival Russian governments escalates to the use of nuclear and biological weapons; U.S. and Chinese troops get caught in the crossfire. U.S. and Chinese leaders both prefer to de-escalate the conflict but are hamstrung by a desire not to abandon Russia to domination by their opponent and the fact that the Russian proxy governments are disinclined to make concessions at their patrons’ behest. • Scenario 6: Global (Non-Nuclear) Missile Duel. This scenario begins with a Chinese attempt to seize Taiwan by means of a naval blockade and possible amphibious invasion, resulting in a U.S. intervention that ends inconclusively with catastrophic losses for both sides. Unable to continue the war via conventional means, the U.S. president elects to make a symbolic conventional attack against targets in the Chinese homeland as a signal of U.S. resolve. The PRC responds with a symbolic strike of its own on the U.S. homeland. Since neither Washington nor Beijing can project sufficient conventional power at intercontinental distances to resolve the conflict, it evolves into a “contest of resolve” in which the two sides use inexpensive, partially reusable missiles to attack targets, such as civilian infrastructure and cultural monuments, with the aim of persuading the other side to cut its losses and make concessions. • Scenario 7: Dueling Blockades (and Taipei Airlift). This near-term scenario, set in 2028, envisions a Chinese air and maritime blockade of Taiwan as part of a coercion campaign to",

Washington and its allies also attempt to impose costs on Beijing, with a blockade of oil shipments entering the South China Sea. A period of low-intensity, but demanding, protraction begins with the United States and China playing for time, both betting on how long Taiwan can survive while the long-term readiness of their respective air forces and navies gradually erodes to points that could undermine the credibility of their options to escalate. • Scenario 8: Power Grab in the Indian Ocean. This low-intensity scenario, set around 2033, posits a Chinese invasion of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. PRC leaders undertake this gambit as a horizontal escalation aiming to decisively end the China-India Himalayas border dispute without risking nuclear war. China also hopes to embarrass India as a member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (“the Quad”) by thwarting its Quad-backed efforts to retake the islands. The intended Chinese fait accompli devolves into a protracted conflict as the United States, India, and allies strike selected Chinese targets on and near the islands and as the PRC builds an anti-access/area denial (A2/AD) bubble to shield its outposts. The United States aims to play for time until either India is ready to launch a credible invasion to retake the islands or China exhausts its ability to project power to the Indian Ocean. China bets that the United States will eventually seek a graceful exit rather than risk intentional or inadvertent escalation, leaning on its A2/AD systems to sustain the costs of continuing cruise missile diplomacy until India is ready to fight. • Scenario 9: Proxy War in Southeast Asia. This scenario begins with China encouraging its client state, Cambodia, to repeatedly goad Vietnam. This goading contributes to tensions that lead to border incidents on land and at sea, at which point Vietnam makes a series of demands of Cambodia, which Cambodia rejects. The United States tries to persuade Vietnam to avoid war, but Vietnam invades Cambodia nonetheless. The United States backs Vietnam to prevent its defeat from leading to Chinese domination of mainland Southeast Asia. China backs Cambodia. Each side receives weapons, vehicles, equipment, training, and streams of intelligence from its backer. The war turns into a quagmire: Vietnamese forces occupy part of Cambodia but both sides take heavy casualties and materiel losses without any meaningful hope of victory. A Scenario Taxonomy  Reflecting on this set of nine scenarios, we deduce the following four broad classes of scenarios that can lead to open-ended warfighting in which stakes for both sides must be large enough to justify continued fighting but small enough to avoid escalation to all-out nuclear war: 1. Wars between proxies. In this class of scenarios, the United States and China fight indirectly through proxies, expending materiel, capital, and other (e.g., political) resources to support their surrogates. Both the United States and China have incentives to protract a conflict to degrade their opponent for purposes of post-war strategic, military, or economic advantage.  2. Wars on third-party territories. In this class, the United States and China fight each other directly but on third-party territories, thereby minimizing the existential risks to their",

The United States and China have incentives to protract the war to degrade their opponent for purposes of post-war strategic, military, or economic advantage.  3. Wars with limited objectives or with materiel constraints. In this class, the United States and China engage in direct conflict, possibly even in their respective homelands, over what they perceive as vital interests. But limited objectives constrain the escalation, or external factors (e.g., limited industrial capacities to replenish supplies) constrain the rate of progress toward goals.  4. Wars with negotiated constraints on escalation. In this class, the United States and China engage in direct warfighting, but both sides implicitly or explicitly negotiate constraints on escalation.  This taxonomy could be useful as a framework for generating other scenarios.  Open Questions and Closing Thoughts Neither these scenarios nor the taxonomy are predictive. However, together they lend support for the motivating hypothesis that competition between the United States and China could lead to wars that endure longer than recent force planning has envisioned. We speculate on various areas requiring more analysis: incentives for protraction, implications of economic interdependence on deterrence, demand profiles for protracted forces and capabilities, robust strategies to prepare for protraction in peacetime, and protraction as the exception or the norm.",

This report describes a set of scenarios of such protracted conflicts and provides what could be a foundation for more-detailed planning or analysis. While these scenarios are by no means predictive, we formulated them to examine the above hypothesis and in the spirit of helping the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) imagine the unimaginable: The United States cannot deter what its policymakers and analysts cannot foresee.  Research Approach We employ scenario development as a creative means of envisioning circumstances in which the United States and China could be called to war. To allow free creative scope for this process, we did not place a priori constraints on the meaning of “protracted,” and therefore, the resulting scenarios feature a variety of circumstances in which the United States and China could be required to sustain military operations on a potentially open-ended time frame.  We invited a diverse set of RAND Corporation colleagues to help us brainstorm scenarios of protracted war in an informal group setting. Then, after the project leaders deconflicted similar scenarios and prioritized them with the sponsor based on available project resources, the same colleagues were asked to elaborate on a subset of their initial scenarios, using historical literature or prior military research at their discretion. Each scenario was subject to a round of feedback in a workshop or panel discussion format, and scenario-leads incorporated this feedback into a documented final version. Then, reflecting on the complete set of scenarios, we deduced a working taxonomy of conditions that could lead to protracted wars. This taxonomy could be useful as a framework for generating other scenarios. Caveats Several caveats are in order. First, we offer these scenarios without comment on their probability or representativeness. The scenarios are intended to broaden the aperture on potential wars and to provide a foundation for future analysis. Subsequent strategic, operational, or economic analysis may",

      "content": "3 Chapter 2 How the United States Got Into and Out of the Business of Planning for Protracted War  In this chapter, we reflect on how the U.S. defense planners got into and out of the business of planning for protracted war. These reflections set the stage for why scenarios may be anomalous only from the perspective of recent history. Protracted War: A Short History  The United States entered the two world wars with the understanding that those conflicts would not be over quickly. Both wars had been going on for several years before the U.S. military joined the fray (in 1917 and 1941, respectively), and in neither case did Allied victory appear imminent or easy. Moreover, because it only maintained a small peacetime military, the United States needed time to mobilize its economy for war and field large expeditionary forces. But geography and technology were on the United States’ side. The enemy could not pose a serious threat to the American continent, allowing lengthy mobilization to proceed largely unmolested. Eventually, the United States could convert its huge economy to a wartime basis, turning its industrial might and unparalleled national wealth into military power and, ultimately, victory. In the early years of the Cold War, U.S. defense planners continued to anticipate that a future war with the Soviet Union (USSR) would follow a similar pattern to that of the world wars, despite the invention of the atomic bomb. The Truman administration stood up the National Security Resources Board (NSRB) in 1947 to begin planning for economic and societal mobilization in a future war.1 The efforts of the NSRB and its peer agencies proceeded mostly along the lines of those the United States had followed during the run-up to World War II. Much of this resulted from institutional and intellectual inertia, but plausible reasons existed in the late 1940s from doubting that nuclear weapons would be decisive. At first, atomic bombs were so scarce that not enough of them were available for a knockout blow against the USSR. And so long as its atomic monopoly lasted, the United States could discount the possibility of coming under nuclear bombardment itself. The introduction of thermonuclear weapons in the mid-1950s, and especially the combination of those weapons with ballistic missiles, forced a reconsideration of the possibility of protracted war. Within a few years, strategists and defense analysts were calling for the wholesale abandonment of  1 Geist, Armageddon Insurance, pp. 38–39.",

In his 1959 book, Strategy in the Missile Age, Bernard Brodie scoffed that “one observes how blandly assumptions are made and carried into national policy which seem to envision a repetition in some future total war of the World War II type of wartime production! This ridiculous and reckless fantasy can be dismissed altogether for an unrestricted war.” As Brodie explained, “The duration of the decisive phases of such a war can hardly be more than a few days,” with the consequence that it “is hard to make a case for any kind of wartime production possessing even a modest degree of military utility.”2 In a 1960 RAND study, two of Brodie’s colleagues reaffirmed this sentiment, declaring that “[i]n an all-out thermonuclear war the superior economic war potential of the United States is important only to the extent that it has been effectively diverted to security purposes before the war starts” [emphasis original].3 This development had disquieting implications for the United States because  [s]hielded by geography, [the United States] traditionally (before the Korean War) maintained very small forces in peacetime, and have regarded them as cadres rather than as integrated fighting units in a state of readiness. There is a strong tendency for nations (like individuals) to persist in policies which have been successful long after the external conditions essential to success have vanished, especially when they are pleasant and cheap like this one.4  The analysts warned that in the age of thermonuclear missiles, “we will be inviting irrevocable disaster” if the United States continued to prepare for a future conflict as it did for World War II. They urged that for “preparedness for full thermonuclear war the United States must learn to rely on forces in being—not as cadres about which much larger, newly mobilized forces will be organized, but as the important forces.” Therefore, “the significance of economic war potential in its usual meaning has been degraded,” as the “nation which can maintain the most formidable forces in being is not necessarily the wealthiest.”5 This might work to the advantage of the United States’ communist enemies, as “Russia, . . . a much poorer country than the United States, has supported a larger peacetime military program.”6 In this environment, expending resources on the traditional U.S. approach to mobilization was not just wasteful, it was potentially suicidal. The 1960 assessment proclaimed that “the World War II mobilization base constitutes preparation for the kind of war that is now least likely . . . to insure the nation against it is like insuring oneself against being run over by a horse and buggy.”7 Brodie concurred that the “‘war potential’ of the economy of either side can have practically nothing to do with the outcome of the war, because that outcome will be decided before such potential is mobilized and absorbed into the military system.”8 Therefore, its advantages in wealth and industrial potential might not provide the United States with a military edge over the Soviet Union.  2 Brodie, Strategy in the Missile Age, p. 215. 3 Hitch and McKean, The Economics of Defense in the Nuclear Age, p. 15. 4 Hitch and McKean, The Economics of Defense in the Nuclear Age, p. 16. 5 Hitch and McKean, The Economics of Defense in the Nuclear Age, p. 15. 6 Hitch and McKean, The Economics of Defense in the Nuclear Age, p. 16. 7 Hitch and McKean, The Economics of Defense in the Nuclear Age, p. 313. 8 Brodie, Strategy in the Missile Age, p. 402.",

      "content": "5 U.S. defense planners took this logic to heart, and by the early 1960s, they discontinued most of the former efforts to prepare for a protracted conventional war with a peer adversary. The Economic Stabilization Agency established by the 1950 Defense Production Act to administer wage and price controls was among the first casualties, abolished by President Dwight D. Eisenhower early in his first term.9 Later, Eisenhower took the opportunity to hobble another agency that President Harry S. Truman had created, the Office of Defense Mobilization, by merging it with the Federal Civil Defense Administration (FCDA). The resulting Office of Civil and Defense Administration (OCDM) had greater responsibilities than its two predecessor agencies but a smaller budget than FCDA had had.10 President John F. Kennedy, an advocate of civil defense, broke up the OCDM in 1961 and transferred civil defense to DoD while establishing an executive branch agency, the Office of Emergency Planning, which inherited what little remained of the economic mobilization portfolio.11 In 1973, President Richard M. Nixon eliminated the renamed Office of Emergency Preparedness without any successor, with the consequence that no U.S. government agency still possessed even theoretical responsibility for economic mobilization planning. In the decades that have followed, there was little incentive to revive efforts to plan economic mobilization for protracted war. Officials assumed that a war with the Soviet Union would probably escalate to nuclear use, and after 1991, the U.S. military predominance demonstrated in the Persian Gulf War suggested that Washington could inflict a swift “knockout blow” against any likely adversary. Implications for the Future  There are reasons to believe that the assumption that U.S. military planners could discount the possibility of protracted war in the second half of the 20th century may no longer apply in the emerging strategic environment. Firstly, it is not obvious why some of the confrontations of interest, such as a contest over Taiwan, would be expected to escalate to nuclear use like a clash between members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Warsaw Pact was expected to do during the Cold War. The United States and its allies made conscious choices that increased escalation risk, such as deploying large numbers of tactical nuclear weapons in West Germany, in order to make extended deterrence credible.12 Thus, if the Red Army invaded NATO member countries’ territory, it would rapidly encounter nuclear-armed defenders. By contrast, it is not obvious who would introduce nuclear weapons to a U.S.-China confrontation, how, or why.  Secondly, neither China nor the United States possesses overwhelming conventional military power that would ensure rapid military victory. Despite its lack of global military reach, the People’s Republic of China (PRC) can field forces in the likely theater of operations sufficient to match or exceed those of the United States and its partners. Neither side boasts significant economic overmatch that might convince the other side that it could not prevail in an extended conflict.  9 National Archives, “General Records of the Economic Stabilization Agency.”  10 Geist, Armageddon Insurance, p. 99. 11 National Archives, “Records of the Office of Emergency Preparedness.”  12 For an insightful discussion of this policy, see Ivo H. Daalder, The Nature and Practice of Flexible Response.",

One side might inflict a limited defeat of the other in the opening phase of the war, while leaving its opponent with the desire and capability to seek restitution after a period of recuperation. Alternately, the opening phase could prove indecisive if costly, and neither side would attain its objectives despite possibly suffering major military losses. The ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine suggests that contemporary technological conditions encourage this sort of ambiguous, distasteful outcome. Finally, new technologies could enable novel kinds of protracted war qualitatively dissimilar to historical conflicts, such as World War II. For example, inexpensive, very-long-range precision-guided munitions (PGMs) with conventional warheads could become available in quantity. While even the Soviet Union lacked the ability to mount large-scale attacks on the U.S. homeland without using weapons of mass destruction (WMD), such conventional PGMs might be able to mount crippling attacks on civilian and military infrastructure at intercontinental distances. On a more nightmarish note, technology might also be harnessed to create unprecedented new kinds of WMD, such as bioweapons tailored to effect only certain individuals or populations or neurological weapons capable of inducing psychoses in otherwise healthy individuals. Summary In this chapter, we took stock of recent history to explore why scenarios of protracted war would appear new to U.S. defense planners. We conclude that U.S. defense planners should not maintain the assumptions that once reasonably led them to discount the potential of protracted war in the future.",

      "content": "7 Chapter 3 Great Game Redux  Synopsis This scenario envisions an extreme Islamic group seizing control of most of Central Asia, leading China to invade and occupy most of the region to acquire control of its resources and prevent external support for its own Turkic Muslim populations in Xinjiang. China then controls all but a fraction of Central Asia, including parts of the Caspian shoreline, and attempts to eliminate any remaining resistance. The United States, concerned about China’s expanding influence in the region and threats to regional allies, provides forces to help Central Asian nations defend their territories from Chinese aggression. Chinese attacks on U.S. patrols lead to continuous, indecisive war in all domains, with a static war of attrition on the ground.  Scenario  This scenario was loosely inspired by Russian-British rivalry for dominance in Central Asia during the 19th century.13 It also has echoes of more-recent situations in Iraq and Syria, where U.S., Russian, and other forces were striving to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) while they were competing with one another. China’s current efforts to exert total control over resistant Turkic-speaking Muslims in Xinjiang also contributed to the scenario. Some elements of the scenario that trigger outright conflict also reflect the early stages of the Vietnam War (e.g., the Gulf of Tonkin incident). Road to War In 2032, a group calling itself the “Islamic State of Central Asia” (ISCA) seized power in Uzbekistan, subsequently overrunning most of Central Asia within a few months while brushing aside the forces of corrupt, unpopular governments. China, fearing for its own security and hoping to dominate Central Asia, launched a massive invasion in spring 2033 to overrun ISCA’s self-declared caliphate. The United States played a secondary role in destroying ISCA, mainly using airpower based in Azerbaijan and Iran. (Iran had become a close U.S. ally after a secular, pro-U.S. government took power following a 2027 revolution.) A prostrate Russia, immersed in its own political turmoil, economic malaise, and rampant separatist movements from Kaliningrad to Vladivostok, was unable to participate. Indigenous anti-ISCA guerrilla groups and the remnants of Central Asian state militaries also assisted in the overthrow of ISCA.   13 See Hopkirk, The Great Game.",

China went to some lengths to honor the indigenous guerrillas and other Central Asians who had fought against ISCA, giving them medals and even the most expensive, cutting-edge cellphones (subject to monitoring and tracking by China). Chinese forces now occupied virtually the whole of Central Asia, except for the westernmost portions of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, including portions of the Caspian Sea shoreline, as shown in Figure 3.1.  Figure 3.1. Chinese-Occupied Area of Central Asia While China insisted at the outset that its occupation was temporary and peaceful, its refusal to withdraw and its subsequent actions aroused anger and alarm within and beyond the region. At a time of high unemployment in China, it recruited more than 5 million young, single Chinese men into a special unit of the People’s Armed Police (PAP) to maintain control of roughly 100 million Central Asians. The Chinese occupiers were undisciplined and treated locals harshly, often confiscating their possessions without cause, extorting protection money, looting shops, beating men, and abducting women. Individual Chinese personnel enriched themselves through theft, while the occupation force was paid by “taxes” imposed on the region and by the extraction of its natural resources (particularly oil and gas) by Chinese state-owned enterprises. The brutal surveillance and internment tactics that had been previously applied in Xinjiang were now used throughout the newly occupied area. By 2035, many of the former guerrillas whom China had previously honored with medals and expensive cellphones were arrested or simply disappeared. A few served as collaborators in the occupation government. Insurgents gravitated toward inhospitable mountains, and networks of urban resisters occasionally committed acts of sabotage, but their impact was minimal. On the handful of occasions when insurgents attacked the PAP, the occupants of entire neighborhoods surrounding the incident sites were rounded up by the authorities, discouraging such attacks.  Chinese forces thoroughly ensconced themselves in occupied Central Asia. The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) set up bases throughout the region both for ground forces and for the People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF). The People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) even moved submarines and boats overland to the Caspian Sea, where the PLAN had a small base. Despite",

This was possible because Chinese forces used the transportation infrastructure and facilities that had been developed as part of the Belt and Road Initiative prior to ISCA’s rise, and China had invested heavily in construction of additional facilities within months of conquering the territory. Redundant nodes and links limited the effectiveness of local insurgents attempting to sabotage Chinese transportation, maintenance, and support networks. For example, when railroad tracks were sabotaged and required repair, China simply diverted a fraction of the hundreds of thousands of people who were already expanding and maintaining the tracks.  The United States grew increasingly concerned about China’s occupation of the region, for two reasons. First, the United States viewed the situation as greatly increasing China’s overall military and economic power through the unjust occupation of other sovereign nations, compounded by human rights violations on a vast scale. Second, the United States wanted to (1) contain the threat that China’s expansion posed, (2) prevent China from acquiring control of the remaining portions of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, (3) counter Chinese efforts to menace Iran and Azerbaijan, and (4) prevent China from dominating the Caspian Sea with its valuable hydrocarbons and fisheries. Ultimately, the United States wanted to push China out of Central Asia. The United States worked diplomatically with all five Central Asian governments (three in exile) to demand China’s departure from the region, but the diplomacy was not effective.    Therefore, the United States deployed a U.S. Army division to help Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan secure the parts of their territory that they still held, with one U.S. brigade deployed along the Kazakh-Chinese line of control and another deployed along the Turkmen-Chinese line of control. U.S. patrols continually moved along and monitored the lines of control. At the same time, U.S. Air Force (USAF) squadrons stationed at bases in Azerbaijan and northern Iran conducted intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and demonstrated presence. Even the U.S. Navy (USN) and U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) were involved, thanks to cooperation from a pliant, impoverished Russia eager for cash. A USN destroyer, a USN frigate, two USCG cutters, and various small U.S. boats moved from the Black Sea into the Caspian Sea by ascending the Don River, transiting Russia’s Volga-Don Canal, and descended into the Caspian Sea via the Volga.  One spring morning in March 2035, three Chinese patrols nearly simultaneously ambushed their U.S. counterparts at different locations along the Kazakh-Chinese and Turkmen-Chinese lines of control, injuring more than a dozen personnel and killing two. The Chinese also shot down a U.S. aircraft that had intruded just over the line of control, capturing the pilot. Hours later, an anti-ship missile launched from the Chinese-controlled Caspian shoreline approached the USN frigate, but it was diverted by electronic countermeasures. U.S. forces then attacked Chinese ground units and forward-operating locations with artillery. Two days later, U.S. special operations forces (SOF) launched a raid into Chinese-controlled territory, attacking a command and control (C2) center located near one of the lines of control. The special forces seized specific equipment, as well as a Chinese colonel and two lieutenant colonels, whom the United States hoped to exchange for the captured U.S. pilot.",

USAF aircraft targeted PLA forces in the field and at forward locations, although attempts to sever Chinese transportation networks were unsuccessful because of their redundancy and China’s ability to rapidly repair the damage. Moreover, Chinese air defenses were more dense and more capable than expected, limiting when and where U.S. aircraft could operate. China also launched numerous missile barrages, primarily at U.S., Kazakh, and Turkmen bases, until U.S. air defense missiles were rapidly expended. The missile barrages also damaged U.S. aircraft and ground vehicles.  While the U.S. strategic objective was ideally to push Chinese forces out of Central Asia, U.S. forces sought, at a minimum, to keep China from expanding its territorial control and influence. The U.S. campaign objectives were first to keep China from advancing further and then to impose military and economic costs to persuade China to pull back to its own territory.  Chinese strategic objectives were the converse of U.S. ones. At a minimum, China sought to retain control over its occupied areas of Central Asia. Ideally, China wanted to expand its control to include all of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan while persuading the United States to remove its forces from the region. To achieve those ends, Chinese campaign objectives included eliminating internal and external resistance to China’s rule over Central Asia, conquering the remaining areas of Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan, and establishing influence in adjacent areas (Iran, Azerbaijan, and the Caspian Sea).  Road to Protraction Two U.S. Army divisions and one U.S. Marine Corps (USMC) division moved into the region over the course of two months, and three additional USAF squadrons were deployed to northern Iran. The United States negotiated with Russia to allow more ships to enter the Caspian Sea via its canal. (Russia appeared to view this as an opportunity to ask for obscene amounts of money, at least as a negotiating tactic). SOF infiltrated the occupied areas and fought alongside the insurgents, while the United States provided huge amounts of weapons and equipment to the allied forces and insurgents alike. The insurgents provided excellent, timely intelligence to U.S. forces.  As the fighting continued for more than a year, extreme temperatures (both hot and cold) and sandstorms caused personnel injuries and extensive equipment breakdowns on both sides. Both sides lost substantial numbers of ground vehicles, uncrewed aerial vehicles, and pieces of equipment to attrition, while expending large quantities of weapons. The lines of control barely budged, as both sides heavily fortified their respective positions. China deployed ever more personnel and vehicles into the fight, but it could not translate its numerical superiority of 4:1 into territorial gains. USAF bombardment could not break China’s dense logistical and support network throughout Central Asia, and several U.S. aircraft—mostly uncrewed, but some with pilots—were shot down. Acts of sabotage, attacks, and other forms of resistance by insurgents within the occupied territory demonstrated great heroism that bolstered the population’s morale and made Chinese forces uneasy; however, those acts had no notable effect on the overall military situation, despite U.S. SOF support and even direct",

Chinese attempts to infiltrate Chinese SOF into unoccupied areas for raids and ISR usually resulted in Chinese raiders being rapidly surrounded and captured, although they did destroy some insurgent fuel tanks, with the fires clearly visible across the lines of control.   In the Caspian Sea, the United States sunk two Chinese submarines (as indicated by the wreckage that was found), but those vessels were stealthily replaced by additional Chinese submarines and uncrewed undersea vehicles that had been deployed overland. Chinese boats occasionally made daring raids against their opponent’s naval bases in the Caspian Sea, but the USCG consistently interdicted these raids. The only result was a handful of casualties on each side—and an entrenched immobility of the front at sea, as well as on land and in the air. In the absence of a realistic chance of liberating Central Asia, the U.S. strategic objectives shifted their aim toward primarily preventing further Chinese advances. The U.S. campaign objectives also became more modest: to hold the line against Chinese attempts to conquer additional areas, prevent China from dominating the Caspian Sea or threatening Azerbaijan or Iran, and impose military and economic costs on China. Chinese strategic objectives, again, remained the converse of the U.S. ones: China aimed to continue to secure control of Central Asia, advance on land and sea, and pressure or otherwise exert influence on neighboring states. China’s campaign objectives were to hold the line of control, advance if possible, defend against attacks on Chinese-held territory, and impose enough military and economic costs on the United States that it would decide to withdraw.  Questions for Analysis This scenario suggests some of the potential ramifications resulting from the dissolution of the Russian empire, the subsequent loss of Russian influence in Central Asia, and the effect of China moving to fill the power vacuum. The scenario forces the United States to attempt to impose costs on China while minimizing its own. This leads to further challenges related to the distances and geopolitical structures present in Central Asia. The ability of either China or the United States to maintain sufficient combat forces and materiel at such distances is unclear and will stress both countries’ logistical and industrial base capacities. Additionally, the scenario highlights the difficulties that China and the United States will have in finding a path to terminate this conflict. How does the United States impose costs on China to facilitate a negotiated settlement on terms favorable to the United States?",

      "content": "12 Chapter 4 Under African Skies Synopsis This scenario envisions China achieving de facto control of nine African countries, installing puppet regimes, populating the countries with large numbers of Chinese citizens, and deploying Chinese military forces and police to defend China’s interests. Fearing Chinese domination of Africa and its natural resources, as well as Chinese bases on both the Indian and Atlantic Oceans, the United States sends ground forces to fight alongside the forces of the ousted governments while attempting to cut Chinese access to supplies and bombarding Chinese forces from the air. But China’s decentralized, resilient forces sustain themselves using local resources and retain control of the occupied territories, leaving the United States and its allies confined to remote jungle and mountain areas. Scenario This scenario extrapolates from recent Chinese forays into Africa and other regions of the world. It also reflects aspects of European colonialism in Africa, China, and elsewhere during the 19th and 20th centuries.14 Moreover, it draws on a traditional Chinese worldview, in which other states were tributaries of the Middle Kingdom, or at least were expected to pay homage to it.15 Some aspects of the U.S. approach are similar to those used in Vietnam, in supporting anti-Soviet rebels in Afghanistan, and in Iraq between Operation Desert Storm and Operation Iraqi Freedom. Road to War In 2031, a group of African nations (Angola, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Zambia) agreed to join China in a treaty arrangement whereby they would receive Chinese investment, trade privileges, and security assistance while also cooperating with one another. By 2035, it had become apparent to the African populations and governments that this arrangement had established a “tributary” relationship, whereby Chinese authorities were dictating to the African national governments. Under the terms of the treaties, millions of Chinese settled in the African countries and lived in a parallel society under Chinese governance. Large PLA and PAP forces stationed themselves alongside the Chinese settlers and anywhere China had economic interests, with concentrations of PLA units around national capitals. Ostensibly, these forces were supposed to be training and reinforcing their  14 See Pakenham, The Scramble for Africa.  15 See Fairbank, China: A New History.",

The local populations grew increasingly resentful of Chinese political and economic domination—and of the disdainful treatment by the PLA, PAP, Chinese employers, and resident Chinese populations. The nine African countries tried to break free of China’s grip, but PLA forces seized control of their capitals and appointed puppet governments, forcing the original governments to flee into the countryside as insurgents. These exiled governments appealed to the United States for assistance. The United States had also grown increasingly apprehensive of China’s dominant role in Africa, for several reasons. The United States was wary of Chinese control of Africa’s mineral and fossil fuel resources, as well as its fisheries, food production, and nascent industries. The United States became increasingly vexed by China’s military capabilities straddling the Indian Ocean and China’s extensive military use of African ports in the South Atlantic. A vast Chinese-controlled swath of Africa could not only enable China to exert influence throughout the continent but also potentially serve as a springboard for influence and operations in the Middle East and even South America.  The United States rapidly became enmeshed in the fight, joining in the existing war to degrade China’s ability to hold and exploit African territory. U.S. special forces, fighting alongside various former government forces that had been reduced to insurgents, launched daring raids that discomfited Chinese forces and their local allies. The USMC subsequently deployed larger forces to various locations across the continent, later bolstered by U.S. Army brigades. The USAF and the USN bombarded Chinese positions and facilities while collecting ISR alongside the U.S. Space Force. The USN blockaded Chinese-held ports, while the USCG supported the blockades by doing most of the necessary interdictions of merchant vessels at sea.  The overriding U.S. strategic objective was to drive China out of the African countries it had occupied. To achieve this strategic goal, the U.S. campaign objectives were to fight alongside local forces to defeat Chinese forces and their allies, take and hold territory for the local populations, impose a blockade that would strangle China’s ability to resupply, and impose disproportionate costs that break China’s will to fight in Africa.  The primary Chinese strategic objectives were to sustain control of the African nations through puppet governments, while imposing enough military and economic costs on the United States that it would withdraw. Therefore, China’s campaign objectives were to prevent U.S. forces from taking and holding territory, cause enough U.S. casualties to break the United States’ will to fight, destroy high-value U.S. assets (such as aircraft), and defeat the remaining insurgents.  Road to Protraction Chinese forces proved remarkably resilient, despite U.S. attempts to cut them off from essential supplies and to bombard them from the air. Chinese forces relied on oil, food, and other commodities from within the region. Small, dispersed, and largely hidden Chinese-controlled factories produced expendable items, including weapons; some of the factories used 3D printing and other compact manufacturing methods. The Chinese acquired or smuggled in many goods from other parts of Africa. While U.S. forces bombarded Chinese positions and headquarters, as well as key locations in cities under Chinese control, this campaign was largely futile. Chinese forces and those of their allies",

Moreover, Chinese man-portable air-defense systems and other small-scale air and missile defenses took a toll on U.S. fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft, ultimately curtailing the circumstances and areas in which they could operate. U.S. SOF raids into Chinese-held territory were impressive in their daring and visible effects—such as damaging key headquarters—but not decisive.  The ground war did not go well, either. While the mountains, jungles, and other remote regions of many African nations provided cover for U.S. forces and their local allies, the Chinese contained them within those regions. Supplying isolated U.S. and allied outposts consumed a considerable fraction of the assets devoted to the overall U.S. war effort. Chinese forces had a tremendous numerical advantage over the U.S. forces, with dozens of PLA divisions ensconced in Africa. Meanwhile, the U.S.-allied local forces degenerated into militias that were distracted by factional infighting and looting, often terrorizing the villagers whose allegiance the alliance sought. China’s allies were more disciplined.  The United States also faced a much greater medical burden than China did. U.S. personnel frequently became ill from endemic diseases, despite extensive medical precautions and efforts to limit exposure to disease-causing insects, infected individuals, or bodies of water. Major burdens for the U.S. joint force included sustaining large medical facilities in remote areas and medically evacuating large numbers of personnel. The Chinese troops—disproportionately from the provinces of Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guangdong, where various tropical diseases are endemic—were less susceptible to Africa’s endemic diseases. The Chinese troops were also treated locally, to whatever extent possible, and were either returned to the fight or were left to expire.  As a result, the United States found itself involved in protracted campaigns in multiple African countries, some of them quite large (e.g., the Democratic Republic of the Congo is nearly one-third the size of the continental United States). The United States found itself fighting against numerous, well-equipped, and well-entrenched Chinese forces and their allies. The Chinese allies performed better than the U.S. allies did, both in terms of their military skill and in terms of not alienating local populations. China could not dislodge the United States and its allies, however, because of the difficulty of operating in remote jungles and mountains.  The conflict was contained within Africa; neither China nor the United States wanted to escalate beyond that area. It could be said that the real battle was contained within Africa’s jungles and mountains. The top strategic objective for the United States was to impose enough costs—broadly defined to include casualties, military assets, and economic costs—on Chinese forces in Africa to cause China to embrace a negotiated settlement in which China would pull forces out of the continent or at least diminish its role in controlling the African nations that had entered into the treaty arrangement. The U.S. campaign objectives were therefore to target Chinese forces and their allies to inflict casualties and materiel losses, take territory where possible to erode China’s advantages, and keep U.S.-allied forces fighting (preferably in ways that would garner support from local populations rather than alienate them). The two Chinese strategic objectives were to drive the United States out of Africa and to soundly defeat the U.S.-supported insurgents. The Chinese campaign objectives, like those of the United States, were to impose costs, both broadly defined and specific, including breaking the United States’",

The United States sees an inflection point when weak partners in Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America succumb to Chinese pressure to install social-monitoring systems atop a foundation of local Chinese information infrastructure. Although each country maintains the vestiges of sovereignty, in practice each becomes an extension of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The United States initiates military operations, initially with limited objectives: to set the conditions necessary to restore information balance for three closely aligned partners at risk of being the next “dominos” to fall to Chinese information control. But the conflict escalates through information and trade networks to become a war of competing authoritarian versus democratic worldviews. Scenario  Road to War Throughout the 2020s, the competition between the United States and China intensified as U.S. policymakers slowly came to understand the full consequences of strategic distraction in the Middle East over the prior two decades. In response, the United States reshored key manufacturing sectors at home or in closely allied Western countries, cracked down on the rampant flow of U.S. intellectual property to China by greatly limiting Chinese acquisition of U.S.-owned firms, made large government investments in domestic research and development (R&D), and implemented policies that stemmed the flow of U.S.-educated Chinese graduate students back to Beijing. For its part, China began a concerted if tenuous transition up the value chain by (1) offshoring large portions of manufacturing capabilities to Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America, where the PLA’s posture had grown dramatically, and (2) investing in its own domestic R&D to make Chinese innovations more competitive in global marketplaces. The economic competition between the United States and China thus shifted to the marketplace as U.S. firms versus Chinese state-owned enterprises and “private” firms fought for global market share and for factors of production in Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America.",

      "content": "17 The competition between the countries also raged for ownership of, access to, and control of the global digital infrastructure (GDI) in multiple seemingly disparate but deeply related areas: • 6G. The United States persuaded most of its long-standing allies in Europe and Asia not to deploy Chinese equipment in 6G terrestrial cellular networks. But China’s state-owned firms dominated telecom markets in Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America, where U.S. influence had not kept pace with China’s. Essentially, all cellular traffic in those regions was assumed to traverse Chinese-developed telecom. • Undersea. Exploiting the PLA-strengthened posture in Africa, Southeast Asia, and South America, China gained ownership of, or access to, most of the undersea cables that channel the majority of traffic to these vital markets. All traffic traversing these cables were assumed to be subject to Chinese snooping. • Space. U.S.-owned firms and Chinese state-owned enterprises deployed competing mega-constellations in low Earth orbit (LEO) as adjuncts to the terrestrial and undersea backbone for the global internet. Major network providers had contracts with both Chinese and U.S. satellite providers to load-balance long-haul communications. • Microelectronics. Most U.S. military weapon systems relied on microelectronics developed in trusted U.S. or allied foundries with secure computing architecture. But a proliferation of devices in the so-called Internet of Things meant a sizable fraction of Western homes and hotels were equipped with Chinese-manufactured electronics. • Institutions. The increasingly competitive Chinese technology sector gained increased presence and influence in standard setting, including the 3rd Generation Partnership Project, the Internet Engineering Task Force, and the International Telecommunication Union. By contrast, the U.S. government was reluctant to develop and follow an industrial policy for the GDI or even follow GDI standards, defaulting to a fragmented and weakened private sector to lead in setting technical standards. The U.S. retreat gave China an upper hand. This transition to a Chinese-dominated GDI happened incrementally over the 2020s, with an outcry among U.S. policymakers but no coordinated response. Instead, the United States engaged in only a fragmented approach to the competition—conceptualizing it singly for critical materials, microelectronics, undersea network cables, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, 6G, space, intellectual property, and the standards and governance that underwrote all the above-described areas as separate battlegrounds to maintain or restore post–Cold War U.S. dominance—and deferred to the private sector. In contrast, China conceptualized each of those areas as one component of a broader campaign worthy of government intervention and demonstrated a willingness to accept risks or make trade-offs across individual battlegrounds to advance China’s broader strategic goal of information dominance.  Although the concept of “information dominance” had resonated with DoD officials as part of military doctrine, U.S. economists and economic policymakers began to take notice ever so slowly. By 2030, U.S. firms noticed a pattern of being consistently beaten to market by Chinese enterprises with new products that closely resembled those in development by U.S. firms. Similarly, U.S. firms were outbid and deprioritized for access to production and raw materials in manufacturing hubs in Africa,",

In the late 2030s, two events marked an inflection point:  • Angola, followed by Venezuela, succumbed to Chinese pressure to install Chinese social-monitoring systems atop China-dominated local information infrastructure. While Angola and Venezuela maintained the vestiges of sovereignty, the practical consequence of Chinese local information dominance was that these nations were under de facto control of the CCP. U.S. intelligence officials previously had not connected the dots, but then they raised alarms that South Africa, Indonesia, and Brazil were on a trajectory to follow suit.  • China announced its completion of the first scalable quantum computer, which had been buried in an underground facility in central China. The Chinese heralded this feat as a technological breakthrough, which was confirmed by academic experts. The U.S. intelligence community speculated that China had scaled up the technology to a point that U.S. secure communications had been undermined. But due to a brain drain of U.S.-based quantum experts (private U.S. investments in quantum technology had dried up in 2028, and sizable public investments had been insufficient to sustain the R&D community), the United States was not postured to quickly replicate, let alone surpass, these Chinese advances. Moreover, Chinese investments in quantum communication meant that China would dominate the new market for secure communications in the post-quantum future. U.S. policymakers recognized these events as a strategic turning point: China had weaponized information for large-scale economic and political warfare. Left unchecked, China could block U.S. access to markets and its allies by denying the United States of the information it needed to compete.  The National Security Council kicked off a frantic bout of diplomacy to understand Chinese intentions and lay out U.S. concerns. In the initial consultations, the worst suspicions of U.S. policymakers were largely confirmed. There was little room for concessions: China could not “unknow” what it had learned; there were no means to verify that China would not exploit its localized information advantages unfairly; and it was unclear whether separate, incremental Chinese gains in global information infrastructure would add up to more than the sum of their parts.  Senior U.S. leaders argued convincingly that a broader strategic realignment was needed to defend the GDI of the United States and its allies. But it was also understood that this undertaking would take years, and urgent action was needed both to halt Chinese information aggression and to set the conditions for a broader coalition response. DoD was tasked with drawing up plans to bolster three U.S. allies—Brazil, Indonesia, and South Africa (the allies most vulnerable to information aggression and at risk of being toppled by Chinese pressure tactics)—and to ensure that the United States could maintain access to their markets, raw materials, and manufacturing capacity by securing U.S. access to the global flow of information. U.S. military planners developed options.  DoD planners quickly concluded that a cyber response was necessary but not sufficient: Chinese penetration of the GDI was too deep and pervasive; there was no cyber center of gravity in China’s GDI that could either ensure the flow of information to the United States or disrupt the flow to China. Investments to reconstitute an alternative Western GDI would not only be years in the making but also would be undertaken under the watchful eye of the CCP.",

      "content": "19 The U.S. Special Operations Command tabled options for a simultaneous strike on key nodes of the Chinese GDI, including a small number of undersea cable landing sites, satellite uplink stations, and critical 6G network nodes in Africa and Asia. These options were assessed as insufficient because the United States needed to hold all of its vital physical cyber territory and destroying Chinese cyber territory would yield only temporary effects. Also, the PLA had taken steps to bolster the defenses at these sites, recognizing their importance to its concept for economic and political warfare. An option was considered to attack China’s quantum computer buried deep within China, but such a scheme was understood to be an escalatory, hard target. Instead, DoD—in consultation with officials in Brazil, Indonesia, and South Africa—proposed the deployment of U.S. forces to defend the three legitimately elected governments, to defend their local information infrastructures, and to ensure U.S. access to mines in those countries. The leaders of Brazil, Indonesia, and South Africa agreed with the United States and its allies that, to support the values of freedom and democracy, they would begin to remove all Chinese equipment, begin to isolate their information infrastructures from the Chinese government, and begin encouraging the same from their neighbors. However, both sides of the competition—China and its allies versus the United States and its allies—had identified access to information as an existential source of competitive advantage, and China was determined to cling to its advantage. In response to U.S. and allied actions, Chinese maritime militia ships, backed by PLAN assets, directly resisted the separation of undersea cable landing sites, while U.S ground troops were required to provide security in Brazil and South Africa as China used forces from neighboring proxy states (Argentina and Namibia, respectively) to inhibit the removal of Chinese hardware from the local GDI. Road to Protraction The initial engagements were indecisive and costlier than either side had imagined. The United States and its allies realized that salvaging the information infrastructure in these three countries was necessary but insufficient. To counter the Chinese advantage, the United States and its allies knew they would need to expand their efforts to isolate their information infrastructures. In coalition with existing and manufactured insurgencies around the world, the United States used its military resources to forcibly replace Chinese infrastructure. China began to resist these forcible replacements. What had begun as a short war for information quickly escalated—through trade, information, and alliance networks—into a war of competing worldviews: the authoritarian and the collective versus the democratic and the individual.  Questions for Analysis This scenario raises multiple questions for future analysis. First, could localized or global information dominance be a basis for war? Theoretically, information dominance could be a justification for military action if used to violate the sovereignty of the United States or its allies or to deny U.S. access to resources or markets. However, the underlying technologies are new, and our initial workshopping of the scenario was inconclusive in this regard. Second, would conventional",

In contrast, the infrastructure and people that create, transport, and use the information can be affected by conventional military operations.

      "content": "21 Chapter 6 Lost in Space Synopsis This scenario envisions a collision between Chinese and U.S. cis-lunar satellites (i.e., satellites in orbits nearly as far as the moon), triggering an escalation in which China and the United States attack each other’s cis-lunar satellites. Both sides launch large numbers of cis-lunar satellites with self-protection and mutual-protection capabilities to replace losses. Neither side escalates the conflict to other orbits, let alone to Earth, but neither side de-escalates, either. The space war evolves with minimal impact on earthly economies and politics, and unbeknownst to most of the world’s population.  Scenario  While mutual destruction of satellites has not yet occurred, there have been various examples of rival nations destroying and rebuilding remote frontier outposts as part of gray-zone operations. For example, from 1748 to 1754, French and British forces put down physical markers to demarcate their claims in disputed parts of North America, sent expeditions to those areas, and established fixed forts, all while trying to hinder the other side from doing the same. One of these incidents, involving a young Colonel George Washington, escalated the situation and began the French and Indian War (1754–1763).16 Road to War In the 2030s, China and the United States launched substantial numbers of cis-lunar satellites, orbiting at distances nearly as far as the moon (or at 239,000 miles, nine times the distance of geostationary orbit). Satellites operating at such distances could be used to observe and target satellites at lower orbits; to launch additional assets deeper into space; and to support operations on the moon itself, such as lunar bases and even the exploitation of lunar resources. Domination of cis-lunar space would provide a substantial military advantage in fighting for control of lower orbits, enabling one side to more effectively damage the other’s satellite constellations used for ISR and communications.  Eventually, Chinese and U.S. cis-lunar satellites collided. After the collision, each side accused the other of having deliberately initiated the incident, although it might have been an accident. In mutual retaliation, China and the United States targeted and destroyed one of the other’s surviving cis-lunar  16 See Anderson, Crucible of War.",

The U.S. strategic objective was to ensure that the United States had a leading role in cis-lunar space, if not domination of it. To that end, the U.S. campaign objectives were to protect its cis-lunar satellites, launch more of them, and destroy Chinese ones. The Chinese goals were the same, with the country names reversed: China’s strategic objective was to ensure that China had a leading role in cis-lunar space, if not domination of it; and China’s campaign objectives were to protect its cis-lunar satellites, launch more of them, and destroy U.S. ones. Road to Protraction Over the course of months, both sides raced to build and launch rockets, satellites, and anti-satellite weapons to maintain their own constellations while destroying the other’s; each wanted to dominate cis-lunar space. Satellites with self-protection and mutual-protection capabilities abounded.  Fortunately, this activity took place so far from Earth that nearly every other satellite that had been launched was unaffected by this mutual destruction. The majority of satellites sat in LEO—within 1,200 miles of Earth—a tiny fraction of the orbiting radius of cis-lunar satellites. Moreover, the relatively vast volume of space in cis-lunar orbits reduced the extent to which debris from satellite destruction inflicted damage on other satellites. Most people around the world—including most Americans and Chinese—remained oblivious to the mutual destruction of cis-lunar satellites.  Both sides studiously refused to escalate this conflict beyond cis-lunar orbits into lower orbits, let alone to engage in ground combat. However, the two sides faced difficulty de-escalating; each demanded that the other cease targeting satellites before it would do so. The strategic and campaign objectives of both sides remained the same: to take a leading role in, or domination of, cis-lunar space by protecting its own satellites and destroying those of its rival. Questions for Analysis This scenario describes a conflict that is both relatively esoteric and highly technical. A war in space confined to cis-lunar satellites could have minimal impact. But it calls into question how such conflicts would fail to broaden to other space orbits or other warfare domains. The escalation dynamics that dictate terrestrial conflict or even LEOs may not apply in these isolated and technical regimes. The key question here is, are there ways to de-escalate from this crisis? Both the United States and China are losing, and the only possible winners are third parties (such as Russia). What types of talks or mutual guarantees, preferably ones that are difficult to break, could the two sides undertake to step out of this conflict? To what extent can the rest of the world be encouraged either to assist in de-escalation, or if that fails, to support the U.S. position?",

      "content": "23 Chapter 7 Russia Nukes Itself  Synopsis This scenario opens with the disintegration of Vladimir Putin’s regime and the emergence of multiple nuclear-armed rival governments competing for control of the territory of the Russian Federation. The United States and its allies support a government based in Saint Petersburg that controls a large fraction of European Russia, while the PRC supports a government based in Novosibirsk that controls much of Siberia and Russian East Asia. Washington and Beijing send military personnel to Russia to support their respective proxies there. Conflict between the rival Russian governments escalates to the use of nuclear and biological weapons; U.S. and Chinese troops get caught in the crossfire. U.S. and Chinese leaders both prefer to de-escalate the conflict but are hamstrung by both a desire not to abandon Russia to domination by the other and the fact that the Russian proxy governments are disinclined to make concessions at their patrons’ behest. Scenario  Road to War Because Vladimir Putin prevented the emergence of plausible successors, the Russian Federation collapsed along with his personal rule. In its stead rose a multitude of rival governments in various parts of Russian territory. Some of these so-called governments claimed to be the legitimate successor of the Russian government, while others in areas such as Tatarstan, the North Caucasus, and Kaliningrad sought to establish their independence. Most of these governments had de facto control over relatively small islands of territory surrounded by large swaths of contested or ungoverned countryside.  Eventually, two of the rival governments consolidated enough control to attract the patronage of the world’s superpowers, the United States and the PRC, as “legitimate” heirs to the Russian Federation. The first of these claimants, based primarily in Saint Petersburg in the western part of European Russia, styled itself as the “Russian Federation” and asserted somewhat implausibly that it was a “democratic” continuation of Putin’s rule. While not particularly democratic in practice, this government attracted the support of the United States and the European Union. Its rival in the east rose with the direct materiel and military support of Beijing, which felt the need to forestall the possibility that the Russian territory bordering on China might fall under the control of a U.S.-oriented government. For this reason, the Novosibirsk government styled itself as a “Chinese-style” state: Asserting that the 1993 Russian constitution had been an illegitimate coup, the Novosibirsk",

The Saint Petersburg government possessed a larger population, but the Novosibirsk government controlled a much greater amount of territory and, consequently, a much larger portion of Russia’s natural resources. In part thanks to earlier and more-extensive Chinese intervention on its behalf, the Novosibirsk government had crushed its rivals in Siberia and consolidated its control from Ekaterinburg to Vladivostok. In contrast, the Saint Petersburg government faced resilient separatist movements and rivals either within its much smaller territory or bordering on it. The most important rivals were a succession of short-lived governments in the city of Moscow, each of which asserted that it was the true heir to Putin. Both the Saint Petersburg and the Novosibirsk governments coveted Moscow in the belief that its capture would allow them to consolidate their control over the whole country. In a series of intrigues and military misadventures, each sought to co-opt the government of Moscow by stratagem or to capture it by force, without enduring effect. In addition to fighting over territory and natural resources, the rival governments competed for the remnants of the Russian Federation’s military assets, particularly its WMD. As the country’s economy and infrastructure degraded, both governments lost their abilities to conduct conventional military operations on their own without foreign military assistance. For example, even though both governments had ample stocks of legacy Soviet- and Russian-made armored vehicles, the breakdown of the supply chains for spare parts and fuel made those vehicles hard to employ in battle. Nor did either government ever command an ample supply of manpower. Even before the war, Russia’s demographic crisis had restricted the supply of military-age men. After the breakdown of the central Russian government, millions of Russian citizens, disproportionately those with marketable skills, fled the country. These constraints prompted the Saint Petersburg and Novosibirsk governments to see WMD, including nuclear weapons, as an essential solution to their problems. Unfortunately, both governments had inherited sufficient facilities and personnel to retain a viable WMD capability. Unlike during the breakup of the Soviet Union, when the organization responsible for oversight and control of nuclear weapons (the 12th Main Directorate of the Ministry of Defense) transferred its loyalties from Mikhail Gorbachev to Boris Yeltsin without major incident, both the Saint Petersburg and Novosibirsk governments gained the services of individuals with sufficient knowledge of the Russian nuclear C2 system and the permissive action links to make captured nuclear warheads usable.18 Because of the geographic distribution of Russian nuclear assets, each government acquired a different mix of usable systems and capabilities, but each mix contained significant arsenals of credible (if not always reliable) strategic and tactical nuclear weapons for a period of at least a few years. Recognition that the Saint Petersburg and Novosibirsk governments were losing their conventional military capabilities and increasing their reliance upon nuclear weapons impelled both the West and the PRC to deploy military forces on Russian territory. Washington and Beijing had various rationales for these commitments.  17 The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic was the largest of the 15 constituent republics of the former USSR—all of which, including Russia, seceded from the USSR in 1991. 18 Parker, “Why the Soviet Nuclear Arsenal Stayed Secure as the Nation Collapsed.”",

Deploying troops was not just a show of support, but it was also a vote of confidence by each superpower’s constituency that its proxy regime would prevail. At first, the deployed Western troops mainly served as advisors, trainers, and logistical support, but fairly quickly the troops sent to assist the Saint Petersburg government became involved in combat operations against its rivals in European Russia, eventually including campaigns intended to capture Moscow. Secondly, while both the West and China had hawks determined to deny Russia to the other side by whatever means necessary, each also had many pragmatists who hoped that intervention would build an off-ramp to stabilize the conflict. Strategists on both sides wagered that the presence of their foreign troops would encourage restraint on the part of the other superpower. U.S. pundits suggested that Beijing would restrain its proxies in Novosibirsk from actions that might kill U.S. troops; Chinese officials reasoned similarly that their U.S. counterparts would surely discourage the Saint Petersburg government from doing anything that might result in Chinese casualties. Via semi-official channels, Western and Chinese diplomats proposed schemes to settle the conflict and reduce the availability of WMD to the rival Russian governments. These explorations fed into suspicions in both Saint Petersburg and Novosibirsk that neither Washington nor Beijing could be trusted. Differences among Western allies about the separatist movements in areas adjacent to territories controlled by the Saint Petersburg government aggravated its suspicions of Western reliability. A particular sore spot was the former enclave of Kaliningrad, which had declared itself the “European Russian Republic” and openly sought integration into the European Union and NATO as a Russian-speaking democratic state. Several former Soviet republics and Warsaw Pact members, such as Ukraine and Poland, recognized this government, while the United States and Western European governments maintained an ambiguous position toward Kaliningrad. This ambiguity not only infuriated the Saint Petersburg government, which claimed Kaliningrad and all other territories of the Russian Federation as its territory, but also fueled rhetoric from Novosibirsk and its PRC backers that the West openly aimed to partition Russia to Western benefit. Some intemperate personalities in the Saint Petersburg government advocated the hardball strategies and brinksmanship of exploiting its primary piece of leverage—its nuclear arsenal—to compel the West to acquiesce to Saint Petersburg’s position regarding Kaliningrad. Over the course of several hours on XX/YY/203Z, a series of low-yield nuclear detonations (of approximately 4–5 kilotons each) exploded around Moscow. Because these detonations occurred at ground level, they resulted in fallout effects that made most of the city uninhabitable, even though only a fraction of the city had been leveled by the blast effects. At a stroke, both the Moscow government and the hopes of the two major contestants for control of Russia’s historical capital had been reduced to radioactive ash. Culpability for the nuclear attacks remained unclear. The Western intelligence community determined, on the basis of nuclear forensics, that the Moscow explosions had been crude “gun-type” devices akin to that dropped on Hiroshima, cobbled together using highly enriched uranium intended for Soviet research reactors. These devices differed from the highly sophisticated Russian-designed nuclear warheads possessed by both the Saint Petersburg and Novosibirsk governments. It was conceivable that one of the minor participants in the ongoing civil war in Russia could have assembled",

However, the nuclear conflict that ensued made it impossible to investigate these claims in detail. The Saint Petersburg and Novosibirsk governments both accused the other of having destroyed Moscow in a “false-flag” attack with the intent of denying the city to the other. Either government could have assembled the primitive nuclear weapons more easily than one of the minor successor states could have. Some foreign intelligence officials in both China and the West found these accusations plausible. The discombobulated nature of both governments—and the inclusion of extremist elements in each—made it conceivable that some rogue faction within either one could have mounted the attacks on its own initiative. In the aftermath of the Moscow strike, the United States and the PRC emerged with strategic and campaign objectives that were even more counterposed. Not only did Washington and Beijing seek to establish its favored proxy government as the legitimate Russian successor state, but also the West sought to limit collateral damage outside Russia and to protect civilians, whereas China focused on limiting collateral damage to itself and sapping Western attention and resources as a competitive strategy. On a campaign level, the United States and its allies aimed to provide ISR support to Russian partner forces and to impair their adversary’s ability to employ WMD, particularly against Western in-theater personnel. China, by contrast, worked to complicate Western assistance efforts of the Saint Petersburg government, impose losses on China’s adversary forces on Russian territory, and provide ISR support to the Novosibirsk government.  Road to Protraction Regardless of who nuked Moscow, the attacks sparked an orgy of nuclear and other WMD usage by both the Saint Petersburg and Novosibirsk governments. An implicit agreement not to attack each other’s capitals shielded both Saint Petersburg and Novosibirsk, but peripheral areas (particularly those hosting separatist movements and other rival successor governments) found themselves under increasing attack. Widespread employment of chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) weapons resulted in millions of fatalities and tens of millions of refugees. This paroxysm of bloodshed also directly affected foreign military personnel who had already been deployed to Russia, thousands of whom were killed or injured. The extremely hazardous and chaotic situation made intelligence collection and analysis extremely difficult, so no one side—Russian, Western, or Chinese—had a clear sense of what was going on in Russia as a whole. Nuclear and other WMD use in Russia also had collateral effects outside its borders. Countries bordering Russia sometimes experienced major downwind hazards from the CBRN attacks. International alarm increased when the belligerents began employing nuclear weapons against their Russian rivals in international waters and airspace. Fallout from the nuclear detonations descended in areas far from Russia, albeit mostly to minor effect. Both Western and Chinese officials were divided over how best to manage this situation. One school of thought argued that foreign military personnel ought to be pulled out of the country as quickly as possible, both for their own safety and to delegitimize the governments, given their demonstrated propensity for WMD use. But several influential arguments for continuing intervention",

Western and Chinese officials alike often felt that while the Saint Petersburg and Novosibirsk governments were compromised and faulty partners, the other side was still worse and had to be defeated. Another school of thought contended that a continued military presence was the best option for limiting potential collateral risks outside Russia. For instance, some contended that SOF might be able to make deniable attacks against adversary WMD assets. Self-styled realists proposed a more radical approach: that the PRC and the West should cooperate militarily in disarming their respective proxies. Pundits regularly suggested on cable news that the Saint Petersburg government be forcibly disarmed and that Western governments recognize the European Russian Republic as the legitimate government of all of Russia. The Saint Petersburg government made it clear in private discussions with Western officials, however, that any attempt by any foreign power (Chinese or Western) to disarm or decapitate its regime would result in the use of its remaining strategic nuclear weapons to destroy Washington, Beijing, and a slew of European capitals. These coercive threats blunted the influence of those in the U.S. government who argued that Washington had an obligation to withdraw its support from the Saint Petersburg government given its ongoing war crimes. Even if its threats were pure bluster, analysts also expected that disarming the Saint Petersburg government would probably just result in the triumph of the authoritarian Novosibirsk government, whose brutality and disregard for human life appeared to be even worse.  Questions for Analysis This scenario suggests the possibility of a limited nuclear war in which nuclear weapons are used for battlefield effects and coercion. In a nuclear civil war, actors lack pressing incentives to escalate to all-out nuclear use, making escalation control credible in a way that it is not in inter-state nuclear wars. This scenario raises the question of how well any military power, no matter how well prepared, can conduct operations in a protracted, limited nuclear war. Questions include not just how long Russian proxies can continue to generate combat power in a CBRN environment but also how effectively Western and Chinese forces can function in that CBRN environment, even for such tasks as humanitarian relief. CBRN environments will probably demand the rapid development and fielding of new technologies and equipment. This scenario also raises the possibility that one or more of the actors in such a conflict might develop and field novel WMD.",

      "content": "28 Chapter 8 Global (Non-Nuclear) Missile Duel  Synopsis This scenario begins with a Chinese attempt to seize Taiwan by means of a naval blockade and possible amphibious invasion, resulting in a U.S. intervention that ends inconclusively with catastrophic losses for both sides. Unable to make progress toward military objectives, the U.S. president decides to make a symbolic conventional attack against targets in the Chinese homeland as a signal of U.S. resolve. The PRC responds with a symbolic strike of its own on the U.S. homeland. Since neither Washington nor Beijing can project sufficient conventional power at intercontinental distances to resolve the conflict, it evolves into a “contest of resolve” in which the two sides use missiles to attack targets, such as civilian infrastructure and cultural monuments, with the aim of convincing the other side to cut its losses and make concessions.  Scenario  Road to War In 203X, the PRC mounted a naval blockade of Taiwan to compel it to accept mainland rule or, failing that, establish favorable conditions for an amphibious invasion. A newly elected U.S. president with an unusually high degree of risk tolerance decided to deploy U.S. naval assets to challenge the blockade. The aggressive PRC response to this challenge, combined with assertive U.S. countermoves, spiraled into the largest naval battle in modern history, with hundreds of ships sunk and many tens of thousands of casualties. Anti-ship missiles, such as the Chinese DF-21D, proved absolutely devastating to surface vessels on both sides. The outcome was indecisive in the sense that both sides perceived it as a defeat. The United States and its allies sank enough Chinese surface vessels to deprive Beijing of its ability to threaten Taiwan with an amphibious invasion. But the PRC destroyed most of the U.S. surface ships engaged in the battle, sinking six aircraft carriers and crippling several others. The PLAN captured at least 6,000 U.S. sailors, most of them from one of the crippled carriers. The human and materiel losses added up to what was likely the single deadliest day in U.S. military history. These results left both sides in no mood to capitulate but also without many means at hand to strike one another. Between the expenditure of munitions and the loss of so many ships, the war could not continue in the manner of its spectacular opening conflagration. Rebuilding enough capability to either invade Taiwan or to defend it from invasion would require years, even with the levels of economic mobilization not seen since the 1940s.",

      "content": "29 Unfortunately, the United States could not rely upon the use of bases in Japan and South Korea because of political shifts in those countries. The erratic behavior of the U.S. president and the extreme losses taken by the USN in the battle for Taiwan convinced decisionmakers in Tokyo and Seoul that the best way to protect themselves from Chinese attack was to try to stay out of the conflict. In the meantime, other means would need to be found to continue the conflict. The PRC could take advantage of its land bases and the long reach of its land-based ballistic missiles. The United States, meanwhile, retained its formidable superiority in nuclear submarines and in long-range bombers (B-52, B-21) and stand-off weapons (JASSM-ER, LRSO). At this point in the conflict, the United States and the PRC pursued similar objectives: to demonstrate resolve and to maintain initiative while mobilizing for a large-scale conventional campaign. Road to Protraction Humiliated by the scale of U.S. military losses and the perception that the United States was “in retreat” in the aftermath of the battle, the tempestuous U.S. president demanded that military planners provide him with options for signaling the strength of U.S. resolve. The U.S. prisoners of war (POWs) in Chinese custody were a particularly acute political issue for the president, serving as a lightning rod for those who had opposed intervening on behalf of Taiwan in the first place, as well as for those who charged that the catastrophic U.S. losses had resulted primarily from the president’s incompetence. The president aimed to couple a symbolic conventional attack against targets in the Chinese homeland with an ultimatum to the PRC demanding the release of the U.S. POWs. Planners presented the president with a portfolio of strike options, ranging from a milquetoast foray to a bold attack that many of his staff felt posed serious escalation risks. Unfortunately, the president selected this extreme option, which planners had included primarily to make an intermediate possibility appear more attractive. The extreme attack consisted of using long-range air-launched cruise missiles against a People’s Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF) C2 center that was located on the Chinese mainland and was judged to be a center of the DF-21D operations that had sunk the U.S. carriers. DF-21D operations could continue without this targeted facility, which was duplicated in several other Chinese locations. The symbolic attack and associated ultimatum did not elicit the response from Chinese leaders that the U.S. president had envisioned. Rather than being cowed and releasing the U.S. POWs, Chinese officials regarded the U.S. strike against a target on the Chinese mainland as a huge escalation demanding an in-kind response. Issuing a statement that U.S. POWs would be released only “after legitimate authority has been established over the entirety of Chinese sovereign territory” (i.e., after the capitulation of Taiwan), China struck the 613th Air Operations Center in Pearl Harbor with a new long-range conventional ballistic missile. While this attack impaired U.S. military capabilities somewhat, its political effects were far greater. Reasoning that the 613th Air Operations Center was “more significant” than the Chinese C2 target of the preceding U.S. attack had been, the U.S. president demanded a retaliatory strike on an “equivalent” target. This dynamic led to a cycle of tit-for-tat conventional attacks against targets in the U.S. and Chinese homelands. Initially directed solely against well-defined military sites, the strikes eventually came to include civilian targets as well. To hit their targets, conventional strikes at",

Some of the missiles intended for military targets went astray and struck civilian facilities by mistake, leading to accusations that the other side had targeted civilians on purpose. In any case, as both sides hardened their military facilities, conventional attacks on them lost most of their effectiveness and became mostly symbolic. But U.S. officials had precisely that motive for targeting Chinese civilian sites: The strikes on military facilities were not having the desired psychological impact on Chinese citizens. Some pundits and analysts contended that the reason for this blunted impact was that the PRC’s well-insulated information environment kept Chinese citizens largely ignorant of the strikes against military facilities. These pundits argued that for limited conventional attacks to seriously weaken Chinese resolve they had to be obvious and undeniable. This reasoning called for attacks either on highly recognizable sites in heavily populated areas, such as historical landmarks, or on nodes of critical infrastructure to cause widespread effects such as blackouts. In time, the United States tried both of these gambits, only to have the PRC respond in kind. A strike on the Central Radio and TV Tower in Beijing elicited a counterattack on the Washington Monument; one on the Mausoleum of Mao Zedong inspired an attack that severely damaged the Lincoln Memorial.19 DoD lawyers argued that attacks on civilian infrastructure were justifiable as that infrastructure is “supporting war industry,” while attacks on cultural sites and landmarks were permissible so long as they came after explicit warning to allow civilians to move out of harm’s way. Behind the scenes, strategists theorized that providing warning enhanced the psychological and morale impacts of these strikes. This slow-motion missile war evolved into a contest of resolve. Its objective was not military advantage per se but rather to inflict pain upon the adversary by destroying things of value or causing civilian harm, in the belief that this pain would make the adversary change its behavior. As Thomas Schelling explained, “[t]he power to hurt—the sheer unacquisitive, unproductive power to destroy things that somebody treasures, to inflict pain and grief—is a kind of bargaining power, not easy to use but used often.”20 As Schelling warned, though, “[t]he appropriate strategy for showing resolve, firmness, endurance, contempt, and righteousness, is not an easy one to determine.”21 Moreover, military and technological capabilities are not fungible for resolve in any objective, clear-cut mathematical sense: There is no guarantee that the terms of the contest of resolve would reflect the arithmetic of potential violence. If one side can destroy two thirds of the other, and can be destroyed only one third itself, this does not guarantee that it wins the bargaining hands down, having its own way altogether just because it is decisively superior. Nor does it mean that it has about “two thirds” of the bargaining  19 Thomas Schelling noted the possibility of conventional attack on landmarks as a means of signaling resolve in a contribution to a 1962 edited volume: “. . . limited reprisal is essentially a war of nerve, of resolve, of risk-taking, of intimidation. And that kind of war is not confined to nuclear weapons. A ton of high explosives sent halfway around the world to explode in Red Square or Lafayette Park would somewhat serve the purpose” (Schelling, “Comment,” p. 252). 20 Schelling, Arms and Influence, p. v. 21 Schelling, Arms and Influence, p. 202.",

There is no simple mathematics of bargaining that tells both sides what to expect so that they can jointly recognize it as a foregone conclusion.22  Even if one party to the conflict could not count on winning a contest of resolve by having greater military capabilities, each party still needed the means to signal resolve. The long-range conventional munitions available at the opening of the war had offered only a very restricted and expensive intercontinental strike capability. Therefore, both sides eagerly sought new technologies to improve the cost-effectiveness of a long-range strike. One major line of research on both sides sought to adapt the reusable stages from modern space launchers to create high-payload intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs). These ICBMs could hypothetically launch either a variable number of small, terminally guided submunitions or a single very large one. Another research effort on both sides sought to develop simpler, cheaper, longer-range cruise missiles by exploiting technologies such as pulse detonation engines. The side that exploited such breakthroughs first might gain a marked temporary advantage in its ability to mount conventional strikes on the adversary’s homeland. As each side became aware of facilities supporting this research, though, these sites in both homelands became targets for additional intercontinental conventional strikes. Along with spurring a race to build more munitions, the intercontinental conventional missile duel drove a competition to develop new countermeasures and concepts of operations to thwart the adversary’s conventional strikes. Satellite-blinding lasers and synthetic aperture radar jammers offered the means of degrading adversary ISR capabilities. Since most of the intercontinental conventional strike systems relied upon terminal guidance for viability, both sides fielded creative means of deceiving and confounding the other’s terminal guidance systems. This deception-counterdeception contest added another dimension to the competition between Washington and Beijing. While the war remained a “contest of resolve,” it evolved from symbolic strikes on military targets to symbolic strikes on civilian targets to counterattacks on infrastructure and industry as each side felt compelled to prove that it was willing to accept more punishment than its rival had initially expected. Questions for Analysis By positing a race to field new capabilities not to maximize lethality but rather to win a contest of resolve, this scenario raises several nettlesome issues for analysis. Simply building and using more weapons or better versions of them cannot guarantee victory. The rules of such an engagement would have to be negotiated and renegotiated constantly, in real time, to manage escalation risks. It might be possible to shape a renegotiation or the development of additional capabilities in a way that shifts the contest of resolve in favor of the United States.    22 Schelling, Arms and Influence, pp. 203–204.",

      "content": "32 Chapter 9 Dueling Blockades (and Taipei Airlift) Synopsis This near-term scenario, set in 2028, envisions a Chinese air and maritime blockade of Taiwan as part of a coercion campaign to compel reunification. The United States tries to provide Taiwan a lifeline by supplying the island via air in a scaled-up reprise of the 1948 Berlin airlift. Washington and its allies also attempt to impose costs on Beijing, with a blockade of oil shipments entering the South China Sea. A period of low-intensity, but demanding, protraction begins with the United States and China playing for time, both betting on how long Taiwan can survive while the long-term readiness of their respective air forces and navies gradually erodes to points that could undermine the credibility of their options to escalate. Scenario  This scenario is loosely based on recent RAND research looking at the potential impact of a Chinese quarantine on Taiwan and a potential counterblockade of China by the United States and its allies.23 Road to War Economic tensions between the United States and China reached a boiling point by 2028. Throughout the 2020s, China’s efforts to rewrite global trade norms through massive subsidies to its financial and technology sectors, as well as the imposition of tariffs on most imports from the United States and its allies, galvanized a Washington-led coalition of like-minded partners to respond with their own increasingly aggressive tariffs and sanctions against the PRC. Taiwan, whose primary trading partner was the PRC, remained on the sideline of these increasingly vociferous trade disputes. Many inside and outside Taiwan also perceived that China’s power had peaked; its population decline had reduced its workforce, and increasingly, Beijing had turned to import markets for oil and food after having ravaged its own natural resources. Emboldened by China’s waning global influence, Taiwan’s favored presidential candidate in 2028 called for changes to China’s constitution and an increase of U.S. force rotations for U.S.-Taiwan exercises. The gamble was that China would be too concerned with its internal economic stability and too worried about an embarrassment of failure to take military action.  23 See Martin et al., Implications of a Coercive Quarantine of Taiwan by the People’s Republic of China.",

      "content": "33 But instead, the CCP lashed out in a series of calculated moves widely viewed as setting the stage for an attempted reunification with Taiwan to bolster domestic, nationalist support during the economic downturn and strengthen China’s geostrategic position in the region. Chinese coercion against Taiwan began with unannounced restrictions on Chinese tourism to Taiwan and a formal import ban on produce, allegedly enacted for biosecurity concerns. Those sanctions were followed by an unattributed cyberattack that shut down the electric grid in Taipei for two days. There was also other suspicious activity, including unconfirmed submarine sightings, around Taiwan’s major ports on the west coast of the island. Taiwan began to shift to a wartime footing. With the support of the United States and other allies, the government in Taipei began a program to stockpile nonperishable food, oil, and other essentials to hedge against a Chinese blockade or invasion. The United States also increased its presence in the region, moving an additional carrier strike group (CSG) from Pearl Harbor to the East China Sea to join the CSG already there to signal U.S. commitment and resolve. Seeking to reshape the narrative, Beijing accused the Taiwanese leadership of escalating tensions. But behind closed doors, the CCP worried that Taiwan’s leaders were right and that the window to act was closing, so the CCP decided to launch the full-scale air and maritime blockade of Taiwan for which it had long planned. China publicly declared that the blockade was in response to Taiwan’s destabilizing actions, which Beijing now alleged had included a restart of Taiwan’s nuclear program. PRC propaganda contended that Taiwan’s indiscretions had forced the CCP’s hand, which required the activation of the Anti-Secession Law. The Chinese blockade commenced with a series of escalations designed to break the will of the Taiwanese people. These activities included the establishment of a Chinese air and maritime interdiction zone that extended over the Taiwan Strait to the territorial waters east of Taiwan, as well as south throughout the Bashi Channel and north into the East China Sea. Beyond this interdiction zone, there was an outer surveillance zone in which Beijing demanded that aircraft and ships identify themselves and their destinations. The PRC established a submarine picket line further outside the surveillance zone, with surveillance and tracking responsibilities and defensive rules of engagement for engaging as required. Simultaneously, joint blockade operations commenced in the Taiwan Strait at Taiwan’s three main west coast ports (Kaohsiung, Taichung, and Keelung), as well as in the Bashi Channel. The blockading Chinese forces comprised a mixture of PLAN surface ships and Chinese Coast Guard ships to board, search, and turn away vessels carrying food imports, liquefied natural gas, and oil tanker imports. These naval forces were supported by the PLAAF’s air interdiction zone and the submarine picket line. An aggressive mining campaign in the major Taiwanese ports on the west coast complemented these steps. PRC electronic warfare, cyberattacks, and information operations sought to isolate Taiwan’s authorities and populace, degrade the U.S. resupply effort, and control the international narrative of conflict. Most explosively, the PLAN, the PLAAF, and the PLARF conducted symbolic missile strikes against Taiwanese air force and naval bases. U.S. leaders decided to prioritize preventing the strangulation of Taiwan. Through diplomatic back channels with the CCP, U.S. leaders leveraged credible threats to expropriate the overseas assets of influential PRC officials to negotiate for a limited one-week noncombat evacuation operation (NEO) conducted via airlift.

China agreed in principle to look the other way when the United States used the corridor, even though it was well in range of surface-to-air missiles (SAMs) on the Chinese mainland, as well as fighters patrolling China’s interdiction and surveillance zones in the vicinity of Taiwan. In principle, the NEO was to involve only evacuation operations and would last for only one week. In practice, the United States not only evacuated its own citizens but also imported humanitarian relief in the form of food and medical supplies, ratcheting up tensions with the CCP. After the one-week “grace period,” the United States continued its airlift operations through the corridors to both Taiwanese airports. Publicly, Beijing protested the airlift operation, and the PRC engaged in modern-day versions of tactics not unlike what the Soviets had tried during the Berlin airlift; these tactics included lasing pilots’ eyes, radio jamming, and occasional anti-aircraft artillery fire (but no direct hits). With tensions running high in the airlift campaign and airlifters unable to transport oil and gas to Taiwan, the United States commenced convoy operations. U.S. leaders worried that openly breaking the maritime blockade might start a wider war, but they decided to risk conducting convoys of Taiwan-flagged merchant shipping of hydrocarbons into Taiwan’s smaller eastern ports. Very large crude carriers (VLCCs) in Taiwan’s merchant shipping fleet offloaded fuel to shuttle tankers capable of entering these shallow-water eastern ports. U.S. surface ships convoyed the shuttle tankers to port, where the fuel was offloaded and distributed, with some difficulty, via railway and roads.  China warned the United States that continuing to supply Taiwan would result in sharp escalation, but Beijing initially decided not to engage U.S. forces directly. When the United States continued to conduct supply missions to Taiwan, a change in Chinese rules of engagement allowed PLAN submarine forces to target U.S. surface ships accompanying the shuttle carriers. While the patrolling U.S. aircraft were able to detect and destroy some PLAN submarines, others went deep and silent quickly enough to avoid detection. U.S. leaders were loath to escalate the conflict, and the nominal lifeline that the United States had extended to Taiwan through airlift and convoy operations had come at a huge cost. U.S. military leadership warned of the potential for mounting stress on the force, and political concerns grew about USN attrition resulting in PLAN submarine attacks on U.S. surface ships. Nonetheless, seeking to compel Beijing to accept a return to the status quo ante, Washington decided to escalate horizontally. U.S. leadership implemented an “asymmetric” approach that involved leading an international coalition to apply economic, political, and cultural sanctions on the PRC while mounting an air and maritime blockade of the straits in Southeast Asia, including the Strait of Malacca and alternative routes leading to China. Economic sanctions included freezing all U.S. assets in China, ending dollar-based transactions with Chinese entities, and confiscating Chinese-operated and -owned investments. The United States also sought commitments from allies and partners to freeze Chinese information technology companies out of various components of digital infrastructure. Political sanctions included building a coalition to embargo oil shipments to China and threatening the ejection of the PRC from international organizations. Meanwhile, the United States established the air and maritime blockade operations in the straits in Southeast Asia, through which the PRC imported more than 80 percent of its oil. In partnership with regional U.S. allies, Washington deployed Maritime Blockade Task Forces (MBTFs) at three",

Targeted vessels were subject to boarding, inspection, and, in the event of noncompliance, takedown through diversion to friendly ports. Figure 9.1. U.S. Blockade in the Straits in Southeast Asia and Solomon Sea The presence of U.S. forces in the straits in Southeast Asia significantly reduced oil shipments to mainland China, but the impact resulted more from diplomacy and market perceptions as opposed to the physical interdiction of VLCCs. Western private shipping companies stopped transiting the straits due to concerns about skyrocketing insurance premiums. The Chinese state-owned shipping giant, COSCO, still transited the straits. China responded to the U.S. blockade in the straits in Southeast Asia by requiring a portion of its more than 40 state-owned, COSCO-operated VLCCS to continue transiting the straits.  The U.S. MBTFs at each chokepoint searched only one VLCC per day, but each VLCC carried more than 2 million barrels of crude oil per trip. While this amount was significant, China calculated that it could sustain the losses by moving the COSCO fleet to maximum operating tempo and sometimes operated ten VLCCs at a time in the straits in Southeast Asia. When the U.S. MBTFs boarded COSCO VLCCs, they impounded them. Doing so required the U.S. MBTFs to escort the vessels and crews to a quarantine anchorage some distance from a friendly country port. If the crew refused to leave voluntarily, then the U.S. MBTFs provided a crew to direct the VLCC to the designated port. The United States then auctioned off the VLCC.",

      "content": "36 Road to Protraction With both sides playing for time in a war of exhaustion, it was clear one month into hostilities that Taiwan’s survival was in doubt. By this time, it had become clear that the military operations were likely to drag out for months or years. The conflict would last as long as China perceived that it was on track to compel Taiwan’s capitulation and the United States believed that it could continue providing Taiwan a lifeline. If either side started to doubt those outcomes, the conflict would escalate to a broader war. The airlift operation kept Taiwan afloat, but it cost the United States considerable resources and constantly ran the risk of escalation. The U.S. hydrocarbon blockade in the straits was also costly, requiring the United States to maintain four MBTFs around the clock. Both theaters—the East China Sea and the straits in Southeast Asia—had two CSGs each, placing additional strain on the U.S. naval force in terms of long-term presence. Chinese blockade operations, meanwhile, were going strong, and the contest between U.S. and Chinese anti-submarine warfare was burning through hard-to-replace submarines on both sides. U.S. military planners estimated that U.S. relief operations could extend Taiwan’s survival under blockade well beyond two weeks, but it was unclear exactly how long Taiwan could survive on the U.S. lifeline and stockpiles. Moreover, Taiwanese industry had already ground to a halt, including its semiconductor manufacturing, so little was being exported from Taiwan at this point. U.S. intelligence estimated that the PRC could sustain its economy on its available strategic oil reserve for about six months, assuming the U.S. blockade in the straits was porous; after that point, fuel shortages could start to force hard choices for the Chinese economy. Although the CCP had ventured into its own blockade of Taiwan to avoid the risk, costs, and diplomatic blowback of an amphibious assault on the island, the CCP was holding forces in reserve for that latter purpose. The United States, too, was holding forces in reserve in the event that hostilities would escalate. The enduring presence of CSGs in both the East China Sea and the straits in Southeast Asia stressed the U.S. naval readiness that would be required to defeat a Chinese amphibious invasion of Taiwan. Questions for Analysis This scenario raises a number of operational and economic questions that analysts might consider. The imposition of a blockade is considered an act of war. But China has an entire range of potential actions it can take that span the gap between completely open trade and a blockade. How should the United States respond to a Chinese quarantine of Taiwan that imposes costs on the United States but falls short of a blockade. Given the differential ability between China and Taiwan to resist a maritime blockade and the significant disparity in stockpiles, what coercive actions are open to the United States? Finally, how does the United States maintain its support for Taiwan in a quarantine scenario in which the halting of Taiwanese semiconductors is likely to result in a significant and enduring economic shock to the global economy. Does the Chinese desire for reunification of Taiwan give it more willingness to suffer economic hardship?",

PRC leaders undertake this gambit as a horizontal escalation aiming to decisively end the China-India Himalayas border dispute without risking nuclear war. China also hopes to embarrass India as a member of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (“the Quad”) by thwarting its Quad-backed efforts to retake the islands. The intended Chinese fait accompli devolves into a protracted conflict as the United States, India, and allies strike selected Chinese targets on and near the islands and as the PRC builds an anti-access and area denial (A2/AD) bubble to shield its outposts. The United States aims to play for time until either India is ready to launch a credible invasion to retake the islands or China exhausts its ability to project power to the Indian Ocean. China bets that the United States will eventually seek a graceful exit rather than risk intentional or inadvertent escalation, leaning on its A2/AD systems to sustain the costs of continuing cruise missile diplomacy until India is ready to fight.  Scenario  Road to War By 2028, China secured a position of geopolitical and economic strength in the Indo-Pacific. After years of increasingly coercive PRC gray-zone tactics, Taiwan’s political parties grew eager to appease Beijing simply to maintain the status quo. Meanwhile, China’s de facto control of air and space in the South China Sea cowed disputants from contesting Chinese territorial claims to islands coveted by Beijing. South Korea and Japan moved closer to the United States as the PRC grew more assertive, and India’s relationship with the United States, Japan, and Australia within the Quad developed to be more alliance-like. By 2033, the Quad had been conducting annual “Quad Plus” naval exercises in the Bay of Bengal for over a decade and had deepened intelligence sharing (although it still lacked formal common defense agreements among the members). Meanwhile, while publicly claiming otherwise, China had been setting the stage for its eventual domination of the Indian Ocean. Beijing had increasingly viewed India as its main economic and geopolitical obstacle to dominance in the region, both because New Delhi inhibited China’s assured access to ports and even military basing in the Indian Ocean, a sea line of communication (SLOC) for",

Throughout the 2020s, China steadily worked to counter Indian influence in the region by pouring cash into its smaller nations. Desperate for resources to address mounting infrastructure problems resulting from climate change, these nations faced immense temptations to accept PRC funding. These financial incentives pushed nations previously aligned with India (Sri Lanka, the Maldives, Mauritius, and the Seychelles) and with France (Madagascar and Comoros) closer to the PRC and, at a minimum, almost guaranteed that these nations would maintain a neutral position in a U.S.-China war. In the mid-2020s, China leveraged Djibouti’s debt to China to force the tiny country to break its U.S. and other basing leases. Beijing offered cash to bail out Djibouti if it allowed China to expand its naval base and to control a deepwater port situated along the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, which connects the western Indian Ocean with the Red Sea. A string of additional Chinese base openings followed, including an airfield in Cambodia and a second naval base at the deepwater port, Hambantota, in Sri Lanka. These bases, when combined with China’s access to dual-use deep seaports in Pakistan and Myanmar, enhanced China’s ability to project power in the region. China viewed the growing security focus of the India-Quad relationship and the strengthening U.S. ties with Japan and South Korea as threats to its core interest in expanding its geostrategic influence in the Indo-Pacific. Vietnam, the Philippines, and Thailand were similarly disinclined to back the United States openly, but they signaled willingness in private to provide access or overflight, or both, should China’s expansionism turn to the South China Sea or the Indian Ocean. Tensions flared over the China-India land border dispute in the Himalayas. Frustrated with China’s increasingly coercive behavior there, India decided that restraint was no longer an option. The ensuing border clashes left hundreds dead and threatened to catapult the land war into an escalatory spiral. Chinese leaders decided to escalate horizontally. Eager to terminate the land war quickly and definitively establish its political and economic sway in the Indo-Pacific, China opened a maritime front to (1) bring India to terms on the border dispute and (2) deepen Chinese influence in the South China Sea and Indian Ocean by seizing Indian territory at the mouth of the Strait of Malacca to prove the Quad’s impotence. China prepared for an operation to invade and establish control of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, consisting of more than 500 sparsely populated islands, by seizing the five main Indian military facilities on the islands (see Figure 10.1): Port Blair, Indian Naval Station (INS) Baaz, INS Kohassa, Car Nicobar Air Force Station (AFS), and INS Kardip.",

The invasion began when, under the guise of a training exercise, China sent a large package of forces to the vicinity of the Andamans.  The seizure involved a nighttime amphibious assault on the islands that went largely unopposed. Jialong Commandos (Chinese special forces) disembarked via helicopter and via amphibious assault ships at four of the five Indian Armed Forces’ locations—all except Port Blair, the home of Andaman and Nicobar Command, where the majority of Indian military personnel were located. Chinese forces met minimal resistance initially and quietly seized the airfields and unguarded facilities on the four islands. India’s antisubmarine warfare capabilities on the islands were destroyed by China in the initial invasion. Then, under carrier-borne fighter cover, columns of PLAN amphibious landing craft arrived on Port Blair. Chinese fighters bombed the command headquarters and the barracks, killing most of the personnel on the island. The remaining headquarters staff managed to notify senior Indian military leadership on the mainland of the attacks but were quickly overtaken by the Jialong Commandos, who killed the remaining Indian commanders when they refused to surrender. Beijing demanded that India accept China’s terms in the border dispute and only then would it discuss a long-term plan to give the islands back, conditional to India agreeing to demilitarize them. The center of gravity in the India-China conflict thus shifted from the Himalayan border to the Andamans, where India’s reputation and China’s bid to humiliate New Delhi and reinforce its regional dominance now hung in the balance. New Delhi categorically refused to concede and mobilized a joint task force to retake the islands. India pursued diplomatic avenues and requested U.S. support. In response, Washington called for a United Nations (UN) resolution condemning China’s seizure of Indian territory, although China blocked the resolution using its UN Security Council veto. The United States also engaged with the Quad members to discuss options for supporting India’s counterattack to retake the islands. As an immediate step, U.S. leaders opted to provide military support through increased presence and some ISR support in the Indian Ocean. The USN sent a second carrier to join the CSG in the Indian Ocean. Virginia-class submarines, armed with Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles, were also deployed to the theater. Meanwhile, the USAF and USN provided ISR support to India from the CSG and from Royal Australian Air Force Base Darwin in Australia. U.S. ISR aircraft were staged at Darwin to conduct surveillance outside the range of Chinese fighter aircraft. U.S. forces were particularly concerned about Chinese submarines, which might angle for attack positions to hit U.S. carriers. As Indian Armed Forces mobilized their joint task force to retake the islands, China consolidated its defensive position. Chinese forces prepared airfields and ports for combat operations, including the repair of runways damaged by Indian cruise missiles. To deter further U.S. interference beyond increased airborne ISR and maritime presence, China engaged in cyberattacks on U.S. installations in allied countries (the Philippines, Japan, Australia, and Diego Garcia) and economic pressure on the Philippines, Japan, and Australia. The PRC also launched a DF-21D anti-ship ballistic missile in the vicinity of the USS Carl Vinson, but a U.S. SM-3 SAM neutralized the Chinese missile before it made contact.",

      "content": "41 Chinese forces also established a nascent A2/AD bubble around the islands, starting with an air and maritime interdiction zone. This zone extended 100 nautical miles from the islands and applied to all U.S. and Indian vessels and aircraft. China announced that any attempts by those countries to enter the zone would be met with a kinetic response. Beyond the interdiction zone was a 100-nautical-mile warning zone in which Beijing demanded that all vessels and aircraft comply with Chinese rules of engagement. China enforced its air and maritime interdiction zone with J-15 carrier-borne fighters from two Type 03 carriers in theater. These fighters deployed to the four airfields on the islands and began flying defensive counter-air (DCA) patrols over the islands, complementing carrier-borne fighters providing DCA above the Type 03 carriers. Amphibious assault ships under the protection of Chinese destroyers also patrolled the maritime interdiction zone. China also began flowing forces through the South China Sea to resupply and reinforce its presence in and around the Andamans and Nicobar Island. India threatened a counterattack if China refused to remove its forces from the islands. But Beijing continued to build its presence on the islands, convinced that Indian forces lacked the capability to launch an effective amphibious assault on the islands, which were now veiled in Chinese surveillance assets and protected by long-range precision fires.  Up to this point, the United States had not backed India’s counterattack plan publicly. In private, Washington had discouraged New Delhi from mobilizing. But the international community increasingly called on U.S. leaders to “do something” in response to Chinese aggression in the wake of China’s bald-faced seizure of Indo-Pacific territory. The DF-21D attack on U.S. forces eliminated the former hesitation. U.S. leaders felt compelled to engage in a calculated escalation.  Firstly, the United States provided materiel support to New Delhi in the form of Harpoon missiles, rotary-wing aircraft, and intelligence sharing to help India prepare for its counterattack to retake the islands. Quad members also provided India with funding to purchase additional Russian-made weapon systems. Secondly, U.S. forces launched a campaign of “cruise missile diplomacy” that involved selective engagement of Chinese targets to prevent the further buildup and sustainment of an A2/AD bubble around the islands. This coercion campaign, by jeopardizing China’s ability to sustain and enlarge its A2/AD bubble, aimed to convince Chinese officials that they could not hold the islands. To this end, U.S. and Indian submarines launched cruise missile strikes on Andaman runways and select A2/AD assets while the USN enhanced its presence in the South China Sea and Indian Ocean. Heavy surveillance of China’s SLOCs in the South China Sea aimed to make it clear to Beijing that the Quad could cut off Chinese supplies to the islands if it wished. Road to Protraction China calculated that it was well positioned to respond to the limited U.S. coercion campaign. Chinese leaders assessed that if their forces could survive the initial pressure for a few weeks, their adversaries would recognize the likelihood that an Indian counterattack would fail. India and the United States might then seek a graceful retreat rather than risk an escalation spiral resulting from Washington and the Quad entering the war to support a faltering India.",

      "content": "42 China made preparations to begin relying more heavily on its partners’ ports for fuel and supplies, knowing that its logistics supply lines from the Chinese mainland would be imperiled by the U.S. interdiction campaign in the South China Sea. Chinese submarines continued to prowl the Indian Ocean looking for U.S. and Indian submarines but did not wander far from the interdiction zone where they enjoyed defensive support from other assets. Chinese submarine commanders also had orders to remain in a defensive posture to avoid unnecessary escalation with U.S. and Indian forces. Chinese antisubmarine warfare capabilities, including KJ-260 aircraft (similar to the E2D Hawkeye), assisted with detection of enemy submarines in the vicinity of the islands. China also had to worry about running low on munitions, although it was expending these at a much lower rate than the United States and India were because of its decision to absorb attacks rather than escalate. In preparation for an Indian counterattack, China had begun stockpiling munitions at its ports and the airfield in Cambodia.  Washington’s goal in this conflict was to convince China that it could not hold the islands, because the United States would retard the development of the A2/AD bubble and wear down China’s ability to sustain its forces in the far abroad. Meanwhile, the United States and the Quad sought to bolster the credibility of India’s invasion threat by providing India with resources and materiel support. China’s aim was to absorb the pain of the limited U.S. and Indian strikes to convince Washington that India’s counterattack had little chance of succeeding without direct U.S. assistance, which could easily escalate to wider war. By the end of the first month of the conflict, China appeared to have the upper hand, because it absorbed the missile attacks that drained U.S. and Indian magazines while expending relatively few of its own munitions in defense of its interdiction zone. Although China had stockpiled munitions at its Indian Ocean ports and airfield in anticipation of possible escalation, China faced greater challenges with munitions, ship maintenance, and runway repair outside a time frame of a few weeks. Beijing wagered, however, that the United States would work with India to find a way to accept China’s territorial claim. Both sides feared that expanding attacks beyond the center of gravity in the Andamans would pose unacceptable escalation risks. Consequently, allied and partner bases, and the CSGs of both sides, were safe for the time being. Predictably, the ongoing conflict impeded commerce. China’s state-owned shipping company, COSCO, continued to pass freely through the Strait of Malacca, but most other shippers sought alternate routes. Kinetic activity around the Andamans drove insurance rates to all-time highs. In the South China Sea, shipping continued unabated, but insurance rates crept up as China flowed forces to the Indian Ocean and the United States maintained a heavy presence of ISR assets to monitor that activity. Questions for Analysis This scenario raises a raft of strategic, operational, and economic dilemmas for analysts to ponder. How long can China absorb the punishment of a limited U.S. coercion campaign before it must escalate attacks on U.S. forces or retreat? What are the limitations on China’s ability to resupply platforms, munitions, and other consumables past the first few weeks? How does China think about",

This goading contributes to tensions that lead to border incidents on land and at sea, at which point Vietnam makes a series of demands of Cambodia, which Cambodia rejects. The United States tries to persuade Vietnam to avoid war, but Vietnam invades Cambodia nonetheless. The United States backs Vietnam to prevent its defeat from leading to Chinese domination of mainland Southeast Asia. China backs Cambodia. Each side receives weapons, vehicles, equipment, training, and streams of intelligence for its backer. The war turns into a quagmire: Vietnamese forces occupy part of Cambodia, but both sides take heavy casualties and materiel losses without any meaningful hope of victory.    Scenario  This scenario is based, in part, on the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia in 1978–1979 and the subsequent decade-long occupation, as well as the Sino-Vietnamese War of 1979. It also draws on prior U.S. involvement in Vietnam during the 1960s and 1970s.24 Road to War Cambodia became a Chinese client state, with its policies increasingly shaped by Beijing. Vietnam was perturbed by this, fearing for its security as it faced an increasingly hostile China to its north and a hostile Chinese-backed Cambodia to its southwest. With considerable Chinese encouragement, Cambodia loudly reminded Vietnam and other nations that it had once ruled over southern Vietnam and that Vietnamese “occupation” of this territory—including Ho Chi Minh City—was an aberration that was only a few centuries old. Vietnam, in turn, reminded Cambodia that it had overrun that country in 1978–1979. Cambodia held a massive Chinese-funded festival in its capital of Phnom Penh, highlighting the glories of its civilization, including its former rule over southern Vietnam. Vietnam launched formal complaints, which were ignored. Fatal skirmishes between border guards elevated tensions. These grew more serious when an argument between fishing vessels of the two nations in disputed waters led to a collision between patrol craft of the Vietnam Coast Guard and the Royal Cambodian Navy, culminating in the sinking of both vessels, with loss of life on both sides. The next day, a Cambodian patrol infiltrated a short  24 See Zhang, Deng Xiaoping’s Long War, and Karnow, Vietnam: A History.",

The photos circulated on social media, and Vietnamese citizens throughout the country were livid, calling for war.  In the following days, Vietnam moved large numbers of forces to the Cambodian border and demanded that Cambodia renounce any claims to southern Vietnam, punish the perpetrators of the stunt, and pay compensation for the Vietnamese sailors and patrol craft lost in the collision. Cambodia, backed by China, publicly mocked these demands. China further insulted Vietnam by having PLAAF aircraft repeatedly violate Vietnamese airspace. The United States and other powers advised Vietnam to show restraint, but Vietnamese President Nguyen feared looking weak and possibly being deposed by his colleagues. He made the fateful decision to invade.  The key U.S. strategic objective was to prevent a Vietnamese-Cambodian or Sino-Vietnamese war, particularly one that Vietnam lost, which would shift the balance of power in mainland Southeast Asia in China’s favor. The U.S. campaign objectives were first to restrain Vietnam and, failing that, to support Vietnam to help it win a war against Cambodia, China, or both.  The Chinese strategic objective was to diminish Vietnam’s military capabilities, thereby enabling China and its client state to dominate mainland Southeast Asia. China’s campaign objective was to lure Vietnam into a war with Cambodia that would result in a profound Vietnamese defeat, attrit Vietnam’s army, and preoccupy most of Vietnam’s remaining forces for a protracted period.     Road to Protraction Vietnam invaded Cambodia with more than half of its army, keeping most of the rest close to the Chinese border. China gave unconditional backing to Cambodia, although China did not commit its forces to fight in the country, only to advise and train Cambodians. China sent vast quantities of weapons, vehicles, and other materiel south through Laos and by sea. Cambodia became almost wholly reliant on Chinese intelligence.  The United States backed Vietnam, fearing that a Cambodian victory would result in Chinese domination of mainland Southeast Asia (without a strong Vietnam able to offset the strength of China and its client state). The United States provided weapons, vehicles, aircraft, and boats to the Vietnamese military. U.S. advisers and trainers were sent to Vietnam to assist it, and the United States continually provided copious amounts of intelligence.  The Vietnamese Army quickly reached the outskirts of Phnom Penh in south-central Cambodia but then quickly found itself in a morass, just as it had done when fighting there in the 1970s–1980s. Numerous Vietnamese personnel and vehicles were lost to attacks by small Cambodian units. Attempts to enter Phnom Penh, let alone to seize it, were impeded by small numbers of Cambodian troops with effective anti-tank and other anti-vehicle weapons, by a multitude of mines, and by remotely controlled explosive devices. Vietnam’s artillery bombardment of Phnom Penh inflicted heavy Cambodian casualties but did not change the military situation. Vietnamese forays up the rivers of Cambodia were constantly ambushed by Cambodian forces using exquisite Chinese weapons. Chinese-trained Cambodian divers routinely emplaced limpet mines on Vietnamese river craft whenever they docked, so Vietnamese forces had to thoroughly search their boats before using them, reducing their availability (and sometimes accidentally causing detonations). The roads were similarly",

Cambodian forces routinely rigged bridges and causeways with explosives, which they detonated when Vietnamese forces crossed, destroying some vehicles while isolating and trapping others.  U.S. aircraft, weaponry, and intelligence were of tremendous benefit to the Vietnamese forces, but they found that the Cambodian countryside had ample hiding places for attackers who skillfully used Chinese arms. Chinese intelligence enabled the Cambodian forces to track almost every move the Vietnamese forces made, frustrating Vietnamese commanders. While parts of Cambodia fell under Vietnamese occupation, most of the territory remained contested or—like Phnom Penh—under Cambodian control. A protracted stalemate ensued, with the Vietnamese forces pitted against both regular Cambodian forces and guerrillas, with high casualties on both sides, and with ravenous consumption of Chinese, U.S., and other munitions.  The U.S. strategic objective was to prevent Vietnam from losing the war, or at least enable it to exit Cambodia with its military capabilities relatively intact. The U.S. campaign objective, therefore, was to continue to support Vietnam with intelligence, materiel, and training to prevent a Vietnamese defeat. China’s strategic objective was to diminish Vietnam’s military capabilities. China’s campaign objective, therefore, was to continue to aid Cambodia unreservedly to ensure that Vietnam’s army was unable to achieve victory and, preferably, was defeated.      Questions for Analysis This scenario illustrates the challenges and opportunities of a proxy war with China. In the case of a conflict between proxies, how does the United States ensure that costs imposed on China are greater than those imposed on itself? Inherent in any extended conflict with China is accounting for the manufacturing prowess of the Chinese economy. How does the United States manage its military forces, national and defense industrial bases, and alliances to effectively overcome the challenges of conflict with China, the world’s workshop? Both China and the United States have to manage the escalation dynamics in a fluid conflict. Can this be done in a manner that is advantageous to the United States?",

      "content": "47 Chapter 12 Conclusion The brainstorming process culminated in more than 15 scenarios, nine of which are documented in Chapters 3–11. Drawing from the full set of scenarios, we identified a working taxonomy of conditions that can lead to protracted war. We present this taxonomy in this chapter and raise broader questions for analysis. Taxonomy of Conditions That Can Lead to Protracted War For a conventional war to become a protracted war, the stakes for both sides must be large enough to justify continued fighting but small enough to avoid escalation to all-out nuclear war. Looking across the scenarios developed for this project, we identified four broad classes of scenarios that can lead to open-ended warfighting: 1. Wars between proxies. In this class, the United States and China fight indirectly through proxies, expending materiel, capital, and other (e.g., political) resources to support their surrogates. Both the United States and China have incentives to protract a conflict to degrade their opponent for purposes of post-war strategic, military, or economic advantage. Scenario 9: Proxy War in Southeast Asia is an example of a scenario in this class. 2. Wars on third-party territories. In this class, the United States and China fight each other directly but on third-party territories, thereby minimizing the existential risks to their respective homelands. The United States and China have incentives to protract the war to degrade their opponent for purposes of post-war strategic, military, or economic advantage. Scenario 1: Great Game Redux is an example of a scenario in this class. 3. Wars with limited objectives or with materiel constraints. In this class, the United States and China engage in direct conflict, possibly even in their respective homelands, over what they perceive as vital interests. But limited objectives constrain the escalation, or external factors (e.g., limited industrial capacities to replenish supplies) constrain the rate of progress toward goals. Scenario 7: Dueling Blockades (and Taipei Airlift) is an example of a scenario in this class. 4. Wars with negotiated constraints on escalation. In this class, the United States and China engage in direct warfighting, but both sides implicitly or explicitly negotiate constraints on escalation. The contest of resolve envisioned in Scenario 6: Global (Non-Nuclear) Missile Duel is an example of a scenario in this class. These classes are not mutually exclusive. For example, a key question for analysis is whether and how materiel constraints can inhibit or promote progress toward a protracted war. Some scenarios can",

Below, we discuss cross-cutting questions in five areas: incentives for protraction, implications of economic interdependence on deterrence, demand profiles for protracted forces and capabilities, robust strategies to prepare for protraction in peacetime, and protraction as the exception or the norm. Incentives for Protraction Several scenarios offer incentives for China or the United States to protract a war to degrade their opponent for post-war advantage. The post-war advantages may be strategic (erosion of credibility, influence, or alliances), military (damage or destruction of forces and capabilities), or economic (depletion of resources needed to reconstitute the military or rebuild the economy). Often, the scope of scenario assessment is confined to the scope of the scenario itself. But the premise of protraction requires an understanding of various incentives that may motivate actions that could, by design or accident, extend the timeline for two nuclear powers to reach a negotiated settlement. The actual incentives among the combatants could be difficult to ascertain. For example, if one side does not perceive that it is losing, it is likely to continue to protract the conflict. Research is needed to understand the incentives for protraction.",

      "content": "49 Implications of Economic Interdependence on Deterrence China and the United States are at once security competitors and trading partners, connected through complex global supply chains and markets. Reasoned choices to start, escalate, or protract a war will balance the strategic and political objectives with the risks and costs to local and global economies. The economic implications of war are nothing new, but the depth and scope of the economic interdependencies between China and the United States appear broader and deeper than in historical cases, extending beyond raw materials and end products to a variety of intermediate goods (e.g., microelectronics, chemical precursors), human and intellectual capital, and high-end manufacturing equipment, all of which traverse an opaque network of nations and firms. Additional complexity is introduced by the different U.S. and Chinese economic models and political systems. Research is needed to understand whether the reality or uncertainty of economic interdependence could influence decisions to start, continue, or escalate a war when balanced against the political objectives that may trigger the fighting. Demand Profiles for Protracted Forces and Capabilities Each scenario that we posit entails some demand for forces, capabilities, and expendables that varies over time as military objectives evolve or conditions on the ground change. The prospect of protraction raises new questions less about the precise numerical demands for, say, a weapons program than about the ebb and flow of broad categories of demands for weapons or platforms over the course of a long campaign. Understanding such duration-based demand profiles may be a prerequisite for discerning whether China or the United States is better postured for a protracted war. Figure 12.1 illustrates three notional, but very different, demand profiles. More research is needed to inform scenarios in ways that reveal such demand profiles.",

      "content": "50 Figure 12.1. Understanding Demand Profiles for Forces and Capabilities Robust Strategies to Prepare for Protraction in Peacetime Preparing in peacetime for the possibility of protracted war requires one to understand whether, for a particular resource or mission, it would be more cost-effective either to rely on expendable or reusable platforms, stockpile resources, maintain capacity to surge production, absorb attacks, or posture to repair damage, among other strategies. For a theoretically endless war, it could be preferable either to favor strategies that minimize marginal costs (e.g., survivable, reusable platforms using low-cost munitions), maintain capacity to surge production (since any stockpiles would be consumed eventually), or repair damage (since all resiliency measures will have their limits). For a theoretically instantaneous war, it could be preferable either to favor strategies that minimize up-front costs, stockpile weapons to ensure that they are ready when needed, or ensure that one can absorb opening attacks. The scenarios depicted in this report could span a spectrum between endless and instantaneous wars, and robust strategies would depend on the cost structures and industrial and economic advantages possessed by China and the United States for specific resources or missions. Figure 12.2 illustrates an analytical concept, in the form of a decision tree, for helping to select robust strategies for resourcing either endless or instantaneous wars. Notice that the choice often comes down to stockpiling for instantaneous wars versus surging for endless wars, depending on the nature of the required resource.",

Assessing Cost-Equivalency Between Campaign Strategies Protraction as the Exception or the Norm Our team began this project struggling to envision scenarios in which wars could protract. Our admittedly superficial initial thinking was that both China and the United States would face strong incentives to de-escalate a war with an opposing nuclear power and with a deeply interconnected economy. However, in part by observing the ongoing fighting between Russia and Ukraine and in part by the snowball effect of accumulating scenarios, the task of formulating protracted war scenarios ceased to be difficult. Each scenario can be more or less plausible, and one can debate the specifics. But the taxonomy of conditions derived from the generation of these scenarios motivates a working hypothesis that protraction may be more the norm rather than the exception. There may even be fundamental reasons why conflict between China and the United States is likely to end in protraction. Neither side is inclined to show weakness as the relationship swings between conflict and competition. Both sides are inclined to try to establish facts on the ground prior to any negotiation required to end a conflict. Finally, the perception of how a conflict is progressing may differ between the two sides. It is not clear that they will agree on who is winning and who is losing. Research is needed to understand these and other conditions that could cause conventional wars between nuclear powers to protract. Closing Thoughts  Neither these scenarios nor the taxonomy are predictive. However, together they lend support for motivating the hypothesis that U.S.-China competition could lead to wars that endure longer than",

In addition, any U.S.-China military conflict could very likely last longer than envisioned by traditional force planning scenarios, which often are designed around relatively limited objectives and call for U.S. forces and capabilities that could bring a war to a quick, decisive conclusion. This report describes a set of scenarios of such protracted conflicts and provides what could be a foundation for more-detailed planning or analysis. To allow free creative scope for the scenario development process, the authors did not place a priori constraints on the meaning of “protracted,” and therefore, the resulting scenarios feature a variety of circumstances in which the United States and China could be required to sustain military operations on much longer time frames.NATIONAL DEFENSE RESEARCH INSTITUTE",
